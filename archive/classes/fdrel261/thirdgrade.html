<h3>Third Grade (96'-97' - Age 8)</h3>
        <p>The third grade was a pretty big year of change for me. My teacher at the beginning of the year was Mrs. Garrett at Bunker Hill Elementary, so it was my first year of moving up with the “big kids.” I really liked Mrs. Garrett, and remember that my older Sister Taylee had her as teacher before I did, so this was the second time I had had the same teacher that my sister previously had. I only stayed in this school for about half of the year, because we moved that year on November 1, 1995. We moved about 10 miles or so north, just barely into the Martinsburg boundaries by Darkesville. We were literally about a two minute drive from my new school, Valley View Elementary, where my new teacher was Mrs. Conner. Leaving all my old friends and starting over was pretty difficult, but with time I become just as comfortable here and made lots of new friends. I think my excitement for the new home helped to overpower my normal resistance to change.
        </p><p>The new house was much bigger than the old one, which was definitely needed now that were six of us. As you walked into the front door you would be in the living room, which connected to the dining room and kitchen. It was a very large, open room, with just an island separating the kitchen from the living room. The house was 2 1/2 stories/ranch style, so just to the right of the front door there were two staircases side by side. There was a smaller set of stairs which led down to the kid's bedrooms, a bathroom, laundry room, and a giant closet under the second staircase that was crammed full of our toys. The larger set of stairs led up to another family room, the master bedroom (which included a balcony and huge master bathroom, and a small office. The house sat right on a corner that was in between a fork in the road, a street called Crestview Drive. Our yard here was a bit smaller, but we still had a large enough yard to play baseball, which I did quite often. Our driveway was a semicircle, which cut across from “one prong” of the fork in the road to the other. This was perfect for riding bikes, because we basically had a circle that we could ride laps around. As with the last home, during the building process we had the builder leave several trees standing, so we had a small grove of trees in the backyard, where we built a bike track in the dirt with a little jump in the middle.
        </p><p>I'd say that the move ended up being really good for me. I came to really love the new school, especially the great teacher that were there. One of my favorite teachers, and the favorite of most every student there was Mr. Neal. He was large man with a big red beard, a shaved head, and kind of raspy gruff voice, but he was great little kids, and everyone loved him. He was he gym teacher at the school, which is probably another reason all the kids loved him, and I was able to have him for all three of the years that I spent there. We'd play some of the funnest games in his class, and had lots of unique competitions. One that we'd do every year were races on these little plastic trays on wheels—to be honest I can't remember exactly what they were. You'd sit down on them, low to the ground and hold onto the handle on each side, and then use your feet to kick or pull yourself as quickly as you could around the course Mr. Neal would set up around the cafeteria. I also remember really enjoying the physical fitness tests that would be held each year. There were several different categories or events, like the shuttle run, sit-ups, pull-ups, the mile run, and the sit-and-stretch. If you were able to perform well and reach a certain bracket based on your age, then you could qualify for the National, or maybe even the Presidential Fitness award. If you reached the National level you'd receive a red badge at the end of the year, and if you reached Presidential you'd receive the coveted blue badge. Each year during the physical fitness testing he would keep track of all the top performers in every discipline, and their names would be listed up on the huge chalkboard. It was one of the most exciting things to compete with everyone, and even more exciting to get your name up on that board.
