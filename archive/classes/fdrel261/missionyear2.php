        <h3>Second Yr Mission Service (08'-09' - Age 20)</h3>
        <h4>Fourth Area- Fallon Stake in Fallon</h4>
        <p>After Reno I was transferred to what would become my favorite area, a small farming town called Fallon Nevada. I served as the Presiding Zone Leader with a missionary named Mike Brooks, who was from Mission Viejo, California. To be completely honest, when I first heard I was being transferred to Fallon, I was a little disappointed. Fallon is tiny little place, and the zone is very spread out and full of other tiny little places. Its not known for being an especially productive area in the mission, and I felt like I was unprepared to serve in this kind of environment. Before I knew that, I was in love with the place and its people. Elder Brooks and I worked our tails off, which had become the pattern and hallmark of my missionary service, and the members were great to us. You really connect with members in a whole new way in a small town. 
        </p><p>We taught as much as we could, and helped our zone to reach new levels as far as the proselyting standard was concerned, but that baptisms weren't rolling out like that had in other areas of my mission.  We baptized one younger girl Emma Joyner, and her mother and two older sisters felt especially close, but they had the hardest time taking that last step. As a companionship we taught them every week over at member's home, the Koenigs, but we couldn't them to budge. I remember one particular lesson, a few months after we had known them where decided to just ease back a little bit and try to have fun with them. We played some kind of goofy game with a spiritual principle tied to it, got us all laughing and having fun, and after that everything was different. We become such close friends with those two families; from then on they were way more receptive, and our lessons became much more powerful. I developed a love for them, for all the people in this area that I had never felt before. It was an amazing experience. Elder Brooks and I served together for 3 transfers, about 4 ½ months, and were blessed enough to baptize those girls the week before he was transferred.
        </p><p>My next companion was Elder Jake Ortiz from Thurmont, Maryland, which is actually only about 45 minutes from my hometown. Elder Ortiz had a lot of interests in common, but at the same time were very different personality-wise, and in terms of our style as missionaries. I had become a door knocking, sweat it out, feet on the pavement all day long kind of missionary, but he more focused on working with the members and doing service, which was something I really needed. He taught me a lot about how to work with people, how to show more sincere interest in their live's, and more love for them and concern for there problems. I will forever be grateful for the how he opened up the way I do missionary work. He and I didn't have any baptisms together, but several investigators that we worked with were later baptized, including a wonderful young couple that we had tracted into, and although I never taught them, I felt a real pull to continue visiting them even after we struggled to set up appointments.

        <h4>Fifth Area- Highland Hills Stake in Las Vegas</h4>
        <p>After serving in Fallon, I received the "fated" call from my mission president to come back to Vegas and serve as one of his assistants. Once again, I was shocked and overwhelmed with the new set of responsibilities. By no means do I fit the mold of leader. I'm shorter guy, socially very reserved, not powerful with my speech or charismatic in a group setting, but this was where the Lord wanted me, and if there is anyone who needed some extra practice and training in leading others, that person was definitely me. 
        </p><p>I was privileged to serve with Elder Holden once again, and this time we stayed together for two transfers there in the Goldcrest ward of the Highland Hills stake. We had a lot of things to take care of in the office, lots of paperwork and statistic reporting, working with the incoming and outgoing missionaries, going on splits with other missionaries, keeping contact with all the zone leaders so that we're aware of any problems or needs of the missionaries, meeting with the mission president and office staff, preparing several training each transfer. With all of that in mind, I feel like we did an excellent job spending time out in our area. We worked especially hard to minimize the time spent in the office by planning effectively, and simplifying the tasks required of us there. 
        </p><p>Elder Holden and I had a couple of baptisms together, and I feel like we did an excellent job in our administrative responsibilities as well. Working so closely with the mission president was such an amazing opportunity. President McCracken is one of the most Christlike men that I've ever met. He had love for and commitment to the Savior that I've never seen anyone else, and was a perfect example of fearing God more than man. Working with him on deciding the transfers was a powerful and exciting experience, one that I will doubtless continue to learn from in years to come.
        </p><p>At the end of those two transfers, both Elders Holden and Wilcox had completed their missions, and I had the opportunity to drive them to the airport and send them off. It was always strange taking outgoing missionaries to the airport, but it was stranger to send off two former companions, especially knowing that they had begun their mission only 3 months before I had. My next companion was my great friend Elder Harrison. I have to say I don't know of anyone else who consecutively served with two companions for a second time. It was exciting time and a great blessing. We both knew that it was likely we would only serve together for a single transfer, so I had to unload everything I knew about the responsibilities of an assistant, and he and I continued to try and streamline things so that we could spend more time in our area. That transfer he and I had tons of fun. We had a couple of baptisms, some great spiritual experiences, and I felt that we gave a powerful trainings at Zone Conferences.

        <h4>Sixth Area- Lakes Stake in Las Vegas</h4>
        <p>For my final transfer, I was doubled transfer into an area with new greenie, Elder Holten Pearson from Montana. I would definitely say that training a new missionary was my favorite responsibility. Elder Pearson was such a great kid. He was a hard worker, and was almost as anxious to learn as I was to dump out information on him. I remember us laughing when we pointed out that I had become like old Lehi, desperately preaching to his posterity on his deathbed. 
        </p><p>We served in the Palmyra and Lakes wards in the Lakes stake, which was another fairly affluent area. The members here were fantastic, we let them know from the get-go that we met business, and they did all that they could for us. I was determined to finish strong, to be as exactly obedient as I could be, and to dig in work as hard as I ever had. We got up an exercised every morning, studied hard, tracted daily in the 100+ degree weather, and prayed with fervent in faith over our goal to have 4 baptisms that transfer. We served in the Palmyra and Lakes wards in the Lakes stake, which was another fairly affluent area, and the members here were fantastic. We let them know from the get-go that we met business, and they did all that they could to help us out. In those short 6 weeks, the Lord blessed us with 3 baptisms, and we had two or three other investigators that were set to be baptized in the coming weeks.   
        </p><p>As the end of my mission drew nearer, I was motivated to work even harder. Going home was a scary though to me. I was excited to see my family, and knew that when the 2 years was up, I needed to move on to the next stage in my life, but I loved being a missionary so much. I remember that I developed this nervous twitch in my fingers and arms during the last couple weeks, which I can only assume was from the stress and nervousness of leaving. 
        </p>
        <h4>Concluding my Mission</h4>
        <p>The end did come on August 12, 2009, and I took that long ride to the Las Vegas Airport that I had taken a few times before as I sent off other missionaries.   All ten of us who had entered the MTC together filled 2 wonderful years, and it was amazing to ride in that van with all of them one more time. MY flight home had a layover in Dallas, and so I took advantage of that by having lunch, some of Texas famous BBQ with my companion Brandon Harrison and his family. I hopped back on a plane and then landed at BWI, and my mother and father were waiting for me as I got of the gate. As we headed to the baggage claim my brother, sisters and new brother-in-law were standing there with cute little welcome home signs. They drove me back home to Martinsburg, my dad released me as a missionary that evening, and it was time to start a new life. 
        </p><p>I will always look back on my mission with reverence, tender feelings, and heart full of gratitude. I can't adequately express my feelings towards it in words. I can confidently say that I am a much better man because of it, and that my life's course has certainly been altered for the better. I hope and pray that the same can be said for those that I worked with as I served. I've felt a confirmation that my consecration of those 2 years has been accepted by the Lord.
