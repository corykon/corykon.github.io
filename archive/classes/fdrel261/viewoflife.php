        <h3>View of Life</h3>
        <p>I grew up in rural area, a town called Martinsburg, West Virginia, which is about an hour and a half from the Washington D.C. It's a relatively small place; about 80,000 live in the county, but it's certainly not as backwoodsy as the rest of the state. There are lots of smalls farms, windy roads, and old pickup trucks, but plenty of business and commercial areas as well. I'd say its small enough to offer ample breathing room, but there's enough there, or at least nearby, to keep you busy.
        </p><p>As is the case with most of the east coast, their aren't a lot of LDS church members, but we've got a strong stake where I'm from, with several thriving wards. I would definitely say I come from a gospel centered family, and feel that I can echo Nephi's words in saying that I was raised by “goodly parents.” They've taught me directly and through their examples to live the gospel, and created a very comfortable and safe family environment for us growing up. This is something I appreciate more and more as I've gotten older. My mother has always been a stay-at-home mom, so my childhood is filled with memories of her playing with us kids, lovingly caring and watching over us. I can only hope to marry a women like my mother. My father is a good man; he's worked hard his entire life, and sacrificed much to take care of his wife and children. He's constantly and faithfully served in the church, and magnifies his calling as the patriarch of the family. He's a fantastic example for me.
	</p><p>I would say I've always had a testimony of the gospel. I have believed it since learning it as child, and my testimony has grown up as I have. I was always an obedient little kid, and through obedience to the gospel over the years, I've discovered the blessings it brings. It's become my priority, and a guide in everything I do. I wouldn't live any other way.
	</p><p>I feel a keen sense of belonging and loyalty to my family and friends. I'm not sure if this is a result of my upbringing, or just a natural tendency, but regardless, connections with others are very important to me. I feel that these relationships bring a more pure and lasting sense of happiness than anything else. Family is what is most important to me, no other pursuit can compete, no matter how enjoyable or worthy it is.
	</p><p>Something I've struggled with in life is a tendency to become complacent. I become comfortable with what is currently “home” or “the norm” and can have trouble leaving it behind. It often takes a little extra coaxing to get me to try something new, but I've learned more often then not it is well worth it.  Change, even when difficult or seemingly for the worse, is a catalyst for growth. Life would become stagnant, and so much less exciting without those difficult changes.
	</p><p>I can also sometimes be indecisive, especially when there doesn't seem to be a “right” choice.  I'm normally a relaxed person, and am willing to go with the flow on most things, but there are times when I need to step forward more and take charge. I know that righteously exercising agency—making decisions—is really the whole point of this life. It is that way by divine design. We've got to step forward on our own, and stretch ourselves in order to progress and reach our full potential as human beings. One cannot let things pass them by and expect to be successful or experience real fulfillment in this life.
	</p><p>As mentioned, my personality is usually very reserved, but walls come down as I become more comfortable around a person. Even then, I most of the time I will still seem pretty quiet—more of a listener. I'm relaxed and calm on the outside, but I'm constantly thinking on the inside. Sometimes I'd say I think too much. On the other hand though, I absolutely love to laugh. I love goofing off and be silly, and appreciate dry and witty humor, too. I love being around those who can allow themselves to let loose, and not take life too seriously. Life needs to balance in that way. Sometimes I become stressed over current circumstances, but I hope I can always remember to step back, realize how much I have to be grateful for, and just enjoy the moment. There is truly so much to celebrate in my life—I couldn't ask for more than I've been given.
	</p><p>I would also describe myself as idealistic; I hope for things to work out in sort of a “romantic fashion”— for my dreams to come true. Even with all the stumbling and the failures that we'll inevitably each face, I still expect the same. Because the gospel is such a part of me and my set of ideals, I believe that all things truly are for our benefit, and that all losses will be compensated for. The gospel is perfect, and while the world certainly isn't, the gospel can make life pretty close to that. I really do see everything through that lens—the gospel perspective. This perspective applies to my thoughts on politics, economics, and history. For me it adds a different shade to virtually everything, and I'd describe it as a more vibrant and accurate hue.
	</p><p>I'm not especially politically saavy, but I believe it is important to be involved and aware as much as we possibly can. I'd consider myself more conservative politically. I do believe that governments are to protect and serve, and should allow us as many freedoms as can be afforded without encroaching on the rights of others.
	</p><p>My economic views are very much based effected by my faith. The pursuit of money is good only when it is sought after to do God's work. I want to always seek first His kingdom. Money is needed to provide for my family, and it will afford me more opportunities to serve others, and so I will seek to become as wealthy as I need to be to be able to do those things. It can be easy to be caught up in a quest for wealth or power. No matter where you are at, it is almost automatic to think that you need more, or that you'll be happier or better if you could only afford that next big thing. I hope that I can learn now to live happily within my means.
	</p><p>Again, history to me feels so enriched by a knowledge of the gospel. The highs and lows of the past several centuries seem to so clearly coincide with the apostasy and restoration of the church. I firmly belief that this country was established with the purpose of providing a location for the restoration.
	</p><p>I feel that there is so much more for me to learn, and especially for me to become. It's daunting to look at where I am, and think about where it I want to be. I have faith that progression will continue, that many great and exciting things are in front of me. Reaching those things will require stepping into the dark. It will require making big decisions, changing in ways that I am sure I do not yet foresee, and struggling through challenges that I at this point could not withstand. It's scary and exciting to think about at the same time. Thank goodness for my faith, it gives me confidence in the outcome, no matter the path I'll need to walk to get there.
