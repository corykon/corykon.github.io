        </ul>

        <h5>Personal</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>Take time daily to “destress” (play guitar, watch sports, write in journal, take a nap...)</li>
            <li>Be physically active (minimum- at least few minutes exercise in morning)</li>
            <li>Keep healthy diet- (3 meals + snacks, get enough fruits/veggies)</li>
            <li>Play music every week (look for others to play with, take opportunities to perform, give lessons)</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Short Term Summary</h5>
	<p>I feel like this time in my life is so important; there are so many decisions to be made, and so much growing up to do. First and foremost I want to be spiritually grounded. If the gospel is not my priority, things will become unbalanced and fall apart, and so I need to be consistent in my prayers, studies, and temple attendance. I can't be nonchalant or unfocused when I do them either, as much as is possible I need to take time to ponder and to write as I study. I want my prayers to focused as much as possible on others' needs, and they need to be full of gratitude. Temple attendance and hometeaching can sometimes feel out of reach when my schedule is so tight, but as long as it is a priority, there's no reason it can't be done.
        </p><p>As for my family goals, I want to do my best to stay in touch with everyone at home. Again, life as a college student is extremely busy, especially this semester that I'm currently in, but I feel that it is important that I stay connected. My parents have plenty of counsel to share, but they need to know whats going on to be able to give it. I'd consider dating a “family” goal as well, and I need to be sure that I'm doing my part to seek after a future mate.
        </p><p>Personally, I tend to be pretty focused on schoolwork, but sometimes it can actually reach a point of excess. If I forget to take time for myself, even during the busiest days, I'll end up burning myself out. I need time each day to relax, do something I enjoy, and reflect on what is going in my life. It's daunting for me to think about how much I want and need to accomplish in the next five years, but I know that as long as I do the right things in the here and now, I'll get there.
        </p>

            <li>Be physically fit- healthy diet for myself and family, physically active</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h5> Mid Term Summary</h5>
        <p>My goals that are further in the future are a bit more general. I don't know precisely which career path I'd like to follow, and I don't know when  I'll be married or start a family. I have an idea of where I'd like to be, but really is rather general at this point. I want to marry a women who is my best friend, that is committed to the gospel, and that wants to raise a family the right way. I want to be successful and feel fulfilled in my career, but focus more of my attention on the church and on my family. Doubtless it will be a difficult balance to create, but I'm doing all I can now to prepare for these things.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Long Term (10-20 years and beyond)</h4>

        </ul>

        <h5>Long Term Summary</h5>
        <p>Again, some of these goals are more general, but they represent the type of person I want to be, and will become more specific as time goes on. What is most important to me is that I raise a happy and healthy family, and that I live righteously. I am willing to go wherever, and to be whatever is required to keep me on that path.
        </p><p>Specifically I would like to to become more well rounded as time goes, and hope that on my own I seek after education from various sources, through reading good books, becoming involved in personal projects, and offer to help others. I would also hope my career will afford me the type of vacations/retirement that I can travel and see new things. I want to enjoy the good things that this world has to offer.
