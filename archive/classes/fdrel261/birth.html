            <h3>Birth and Infancy</h3>
            <p>I was born on the 27th of May, 1988 in Woodstock, Virginia as the second child to Teresa Mary Taft and James Kon Fugate. My older sister Taylee had been born 3 years before in March of 1985 in Tacoma, Washington, and my family had only recently moved to the east coast. Early in 1987 they gathered everything they owned into a blue Volkswagon bus, and took a cross country trip to Vienna, Virginia where they stayed with my father's mission president for a short time. They ended up moving into a condo in the area, and then because of the price of living in Virginia, they decided to build a home in Bunker Hill, West Virginia. The construction of the home took 6 months longer than expected, so it was a total of 10 months until it was completed and they moved in.
            </p><p>Two weeks after moving into the new home I was born. Because of the distance, my parents traveled back to Virginia where our doctor was located to induce the birth, and my sister stayed home with my mother's parents, Grandma and Grandpa Taft, who had driven down from New York. I was born late in the evening of the 27th, and my parents and I stayed in the hospital for less then 24 hours before coming home. Taylee was very excited to have a new brother and was ready to help when we made it back. She was the first person to feed me at our home on Stonehenge Dr.

            <p>Originally, my parents had planned on naming me Christopher James Fugate, but they had their minds changed about three weeks before I was born. They were looking through a baby name book and came across the name Cory, and for whatever reason that name felt right. So, I was born with the first name Cory, and my middle name was just the initial "K," which was derived from my great grandfather's named Yukon. The story goes that Yukon's father Jezreel had planned on moving with his wife to the Yukon Territory in Canada to become a gold miner, but when his wife became pregnant they decided not to do so, and the baby was named Yukon. My grandmother wanted to pass the name onto my father as his middle name, but didn't like the full name Yukon, and so she shortened it to "Kon," and then my mother shortened it further to just the letter. It become quite a hassle to explain to people that my middle initial "K" was not "Kay," and that it didn't stand for anything, so my parents had it legally changed to "Kon," a process which took about 6 months to complete.
            </p><p>I was given a priesthood blessing and had my name added to the rolls of the church a litter over a month after my birth on July 8th by my father in Glens Falls, New York where my mother's sister lived at the time. (As you can see, my middle name at the time was just the letter).
            </p><p>I was a healthy newborn, and my family enjoyed a nice summer during the next few months in our new home, which at the time was only the fifth or sixth in the neighborhood. I grew happily, and things were just as you'd expect for a normal baby, but there was one little scare. My mother described one instance when she was preparing to feed me, was just coming out of the kitchen and saw my little hands shaking in the air. For some reason I had stopped breathing, and so she picked me up and gave me a gentle shake, and I snapped out of it and let out a good cry. It turned out that nothing was seriously wrong, just a random isolated event.
            </p><p>As an infant I was very reserved and content.  My mom described me as "a very chill baby," and recalls that I could lay in bed for hours just "day dreaming away." She explained that she could just leave me sitting in the middle of a room, leave for several minutes, and then come back to find me sitting right in the same exact spot, sitting perfectly content and happy. I would say that this is still very much apart of my personality now. I'm normally very reserved, always busy thinking, and today I'm certainly one who tends to sit back and watch rather than trying to be the center of attention.
