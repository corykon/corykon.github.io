        <h3>Memories with Extended Family</h3>
        <p>We were also pretty close to our cousins on my mother's side. Basically from the time that my parents moved to the east coast until later in high school, we would drive up to my grandparent's home in Whitehall, New York at least a couple times a year for Thanksgiving and over the summer. Most of that side of the family either lived somewhere nearby or would visit during those times as well, so there were about a dozen of us cousins that became a tight-knit little group. Those little reunions created some of my favorite memories as a child.
        </p><p>A couple of my cousins were around the same age, Jimmer and John, and so we became great friends, and have been around each other for as long as I can remember. I'm older by them by a year, but I've always been a smaller kid so it wasn't long before they outgrew me.

        <p>I remember that we had tons of yearly traditions and events led by our older cousins TJ, Mike, and Lindsay, who are at least 6 or so years older then I was. We had this little club that they created, where we would graduate to different groups or levels as we got older, and each year we would have what we called the “Loke” ceremony. I can't remember all that went along with it, but to us it was epic and so much fun. I remember that TJ would always tell stories; scary stories, funny stories, adventure stories, and all kinds of stuff that he would just make up. He created these story lines and mythologies that we'd come back to each year and he'd elaborate on them. All of us younger kids were completely enthralled.
        </p><p>My grandparents had a huge in-ground pool in the back with a diving board and a basketball setup, and so some of our favorite games revolved around that. We'd have competitions off the diving board to see who could do the funniest dive, the biggest splash, the furthest jump, the best Michael Jackson impersonation, or whatever else we could think of. Whoever won would be the next judge, and then he or she would pick the next categories.

        <p>Of course as a young child it took me awhile to get used to the swimming pool. I would slowly get into the water from the shallow end one step at a time and then eventually dunk my face in the water, and then immediately run out and wipe my face off with the towel. My aunts and uncles would all clap and cheer and I'd do it over again. Probably around 4 I started maneuvering a bit further around the pool with floaties wrapped around my arms and tube around my waist, and it was a few years later that I was finally confident enough to swim without them.
        </p><p>Grandma would always put together big trays of snacks and bring them out to us by the pool, so we'd take breaks and then gather around to gobble them up. I remember that in general there was always tons of food when the family would get together, and a lot more sweets and junk food than we'd get at home, so that was just one more thing to love about our visits to New York.

        <p>We also spent lots lots of time playing out in the front yard. There was the big porch with four our five tall steps covered in astroturf, a sidewalk that led down to the street and then ran alongside it, and some hedges and bushes that I remember as great obstacles to use during tag. We'd play the classics like redlight-greenlight and charades, a game we called “My ship came in from China”, different variations of tag, and tons of other stuff that we'd make up. Many of my cousins were really involved in sports, so lots of time would be spent playing basketball, football, baseball, and other sports as well.
        </p><p>I remember that we'd put on little plays each year and perform them for the family, and all of this was put together on the spot by our older cousins. They'd pick out roles for each of us and helps us put together all the scenes and practice them. One of my favorite performances was when we re-enacted the Little Giants.

        </p><p>Each year in the spring we'd also take a trip with the extended family to Florida, so there be lots more fun at the beach and the hotel. Just as it was for me in getting used to pool, I'm sure the same could be said about the beach and the ocean, but in time it become one of my absolute favorite vacation spots.
