        <h3>Attending BYU-I (09'-11' - Ages 21-22)</h3>
        <p>Growing up I had always just planned life up until my mission, and hadn't thought much of what I would do afterwards, so when I first got home I just felt kind of lost. After some praying and searching I decided that I would apply to BYU-Idaho, and within about a month I was on a plane heading across the country to start my schooling there. I had arranged to live with Brandon Harrison at an off-campus apartment complex called Nauvoo House, and we were blessed to room with 4 other guys that we became close friends with. Three of them had returned from missions as recently as we had, so the five of us “de-missionized” together. Going from the life of a missionary to that of a college student is drastic change, but the fact that it was an LDS school, and many of us were in the same boat made it a whole lot easier.
        </p><p>It didn't take long to decide that I would declare my major as computer information technology. I briefly considered studying business management, it was pretty obvious that CIT was the right way to go for me. I don't yet know exactly what I want to do with my degree, but I know that I enjoy using technology to solve problems, and to produce creative things. For now I'm focused on keeping my grades up and learning all that I can, and in the process I'll discover where my passion really is and where it will lead me.
        </p><p>I've been here at BYU-I for 4 semesters now, and each has had its fair share of challenges, new experiences and great memories. The first semester was all about transition—getting  used to the flow of college life. I had to become comfortable with dating and the intricacies of social life at an LDS institution, and also learn to balance schoolwork with fun. The second and third semester I added a job as a lab assistant on campus, a more time-consuming church calling as a ward clerk, I became involved with some ward sports teams, and I also volunteered as a promotions manager for social events on campus. It wasn't long before Rexburg became home for me, so it was difficult to go back to West Virginia during my off-track semester in the July of 2010.
        </p><p>I enjoyed being with my family and being reintroduced to my home ward, but I struggled to find employment, and didn't have as many friends around as I once had. After some searching I did make some great friends in the area, and found a job in Winchester at a printing press called Quad Graphics that paid decent, but I couldn't wait to get back to school. I returned in January of 2011, and I'm reaching the end of my fourth semester, and gearing up for the spring semester to come.
        </p><p>There are lot of things I'm looking forward to in this next semester. I'll be starting a new part-time job at a software development company called Corda, which pays excellent wages (especially considering I'm still a student) and will provide some great real-world experience. I'll be moving into a new apartment and a new ward, and a lot of my roommates will be different, so I'm excited for the new experiences that will bring. In general, the spring semester is always blast, because we finally get to enjoy a thawed out Rexburg, which has tons more outdoor fun to offer than you might think if you only attend during the fall and winter semesters. I expect to make great things happen this semester. [April 2001.]
