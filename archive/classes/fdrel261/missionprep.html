<h3>Mission Prep (06'-07' - Age 18)</h3>
        <p>The summer following graduation I stayed good and busy. I continued to work at Pacsun and Regal Cinema's, and I was pulling in 40 hours or more most weeks. I took some time off for my last youth conference, and this turned out to be one the better conferences for me. Most years I felt like I did pretty well at learning from the classes and workshops, and enjoying the testimony meeting at the end of the conference, but honestly my focus was primarily on the social aspects of the conference. This year the social half of the conference was still great, but we took a trip to some church history sites, so I remember this years conference as being a lot more spirt-filled. We got to visit the Kirtland, Ohio temple and were guided on a tour by the Community of Christ church, and also went to visit some of the sites in the Palmyra area. Definitely a good experience, had some powerful spiritual confirmations.
        </p><p>I also took a week to take another trip to Ocean City with Logan Stewart.  We still stayed at a hotel with his family, but we drove down separately in his Subaru WRX, so we had a lot more freedom to get out and do as we pleased. We mostly did more of the same from previous years, hours of beach time (and consequently major sunburn by the end of the week), and lots of fun around town.
        </p><p>I remember during the summer that I was working a lot of 12 or 13 hour days between both jobs, but when ever I had open time, a lot of it was spent playing music. Josh Menedez started playing the guitar and would jam and write music with me, and we played with Matt Moriarty, a kid that we had skateboarded a lot with in earlier years. I also got my brother started on music, and since we needed a bass player we had him fill the role. Jace was about 13, and a really tiny kid at the time, so I remember his first bass being about as tall or taller than he was, but he handled it pretty well all things considered. I continued to improve on the drums, and also picked up the guitar along the way. I actually started to get pretty proficient on it, and would spend as much time writing and playing guitar parts as I did drum parts.
        </p><p>We were never great at writing our own music, but I had so much fun doing it. We put together our own system for recording music, which I certainly wouldn't term a recording studio, put as time went on we got it pretty close. We installed this free recording software called Audacity on the PC in my bedroom, and started out just using a cheap little computer microphone, but Josh and I were both working 40 hours a week and pulling in some decent money, so piece by piece we kept upgrading things. Soon we went out and bought a few Shure SM-57 and 58 microphones, and purchased a preamp that had a computer audio card interface. I went out and bought a brand new 5 piece Pearl drumeset, a Forum EX series, and a set of Sabian Xs cymbals, and Josh purchased a Gibson SG guitar and a new amp and effect pedal. Later on we upgraded things even a little built further by buying an 8 channel PA system, which we were able to rig up to the computer. It gave us some more control over the sound, and the ability to record multiple parts simultaneously. These musical endeavors certainly fit the mold for the types of things I had been doing my whole life. I was using technology, being creative, stretching myself to learn and do new things. Exploring new frontiers like is so exciting to me, especially when I'm producing something that I really enjoy, like music, neat software or visual media of some kind.
        </p><p>One of the funnest music projects I was involved in was for a church function. A group of us in the stake wrote a couple parody renditions of songs, recorded them, and then created music videos for them. One was derived from Sweet Home Alabama, which we changed to Sweet Home West Virginia, and the other was a parody of Weezer's Beverly Hills. Pat Markland, Ryjan Ven Evera, Josh Menedez, Jace and I recorded all the instrumental tracks on my ghetto bedroom recording setup, and then we took the tracks to the Taylor's home on the other side of the stake to add the vocals. Brother Taylor actually had a legitimate recording studio setup, and his daughter and one of her friends sang for us. After Brother Taylor mastered the tracks and added some piano, he sent them back to us. Throughout the recording process we'd been filming everything, so we took those clips along with some footage from a stake dance edited them all together. Things turned out well, and we seriously had a blast putting things together.
        </p><p>In August of 2006 I started my freshman year at nearby Shepherd University, which in my opinion barey deserves the title of a University. The student population is about 4 or 5,000, and honestly to me it just felt like a larger scale version of my high school. I kept up my two jobs, and took a couple full semesters of schooling to get some general education credits out of the way. In the state of West Virginia they have what is called the Promise Scholarship, where if you have a high enough cumulative high school GPA and reach a certain threshold on your ACT or SAT scores you're tuition for any West Virginia school is taken care of, and I was lucky enough to qualify. This was definitely huge for me, and is the reason I decided to take classes before my mission. Otherwise I would have been unable to save any money at all and probably would've just waited until after the mission to start my schooling. I'm definitely glad I got some classes out of the way, but I wan't as focused on schooling with all that I had going on, especially mission preparation, so I didn't maintain the type of grades I would have liked.  All in all I'd say things worked out well enough, but I'd likely be receiving more financial aid post-mission had I kept my GPA a little higher.

        <h4>Mission Papers, Entering MTC</h4>
        <p>I completed two semesters of college, turned 19, and the time had finally come to work on my mission papers. I cannot remember when I officially decided that I was going to serve; it feels like I've just always planned on it, and sort of planned everything in my life around it and leading up to it. My mother recently mentioned to me that she and my father never pushed me towards it all because she wanted it to be totally my decision. I never noticed that, but thinking back on it now I guess that is true. I had testimony of the gospel, and was committed to being obedient. I knew the prophet had counseled young men serve a mission, and so I didn't question it; I knew it was a priesthood responsibility of mine and planned to fulfill it.
        </p><p>For me the paperwork process was completely online. I went through a couple medical checkups, gathered together some information, and breezed through the application. I think the only difficult change for me was cutting my hair. I took care of that a few months before turing 19, but I had also grown out at a beard, so I kept that right up until it was time to take the picture that goes along with the application. I had interviews with Bishop Witcomb and President Grow, and then my paper were off. About three weeks later I received my mission call, and in usual Cory fashion opened it in a very casual and nonchalant fashion. It was waiting for me on the coffee table after I got home from work, so I went straight to it and opened it with just my mother there. A big grin spread on my face as I read the name of my mission: “Nevada Las Vegas West.” Definitely not what I expected, but as far as I was concerned, it was perfect.
        </p><p>I opened my call in the middle of June, and was to report to the MTC on August 8, 2007. I continued to work up until the end of July, but I remember those few weeks were full of surprises. All young men seem to face some type of buffeting before they leave. For some its a young lady; they have doubts about whether or not they can stand to leave their sweetheart, or whether she will be able to wait for them. I wasn't dating anyone, so this was no problem for me. For others its a struggle of testimony, but I faced no such challenge. I continued to do what I always had, fervent prayer every morning and night, and I read through the Book of Mormon for the seventh time within the month just before I left. My trial was with my health, but honestly it wasn't really all that bad; certainly nothing that could prevent me from serving. I came down with an especially rotten flu, lost 5-10 pounds, and then caught a nasty infection that sent me to a couple of doctors and then to the hospital for minor surgery. I managed to catch another bug during that time, and was stilling healing from the surgery when I left for Utah.
        </p><p>I pulled through just fine, and took a plane to Salt Lake on August 6, 2007, where my sister Taylee and her fiance Caleb Risher picked me up and took me to Provo. I just hung with them for a couple days, spent most of the time at Caleb's place reading and studying from his roommate's gospel library collection. On Wednesday morning Taylee and Caleb drove me to the MTC and came with me to the big, joint family-missionary meeting. At the conclusion of the meeting, family members go out one door, and missionaries another, and then it two years of service officially begin.
