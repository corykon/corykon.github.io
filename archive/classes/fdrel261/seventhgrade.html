<h3>Seventh Grade (00'-01' - Age 12)</h3>
        <p>As childhood started slipping further away I felt like I started having a more difficult time socially. It wasn't bad in seventh grade, but it was during these years that I would definitely say things started to change. Kids got older and began to experiment more with things that I wasn't willing to do, and so it become more difficult to be friends with certain people. I had always been a more mellow and shy kid, at that started to take over a lot more as I got older. I still had a lot of good friends, had some great times and powerful learning experiences, but we all know the middle school years are never really the greatest for any of us.
        </p><p>Luckily during this period of time I met one my closest friends Logan Stewart. He was a grade ahead of me, and lived almost next door to us in my neighborhood. He was the kind of friend that I could talk to about anything, and we could literally spend all day hanging out with each other. He wasn't a member of the church, but was a good kid, and always respected the things I believed. Whether or not he fully understood why I did things the way I did, he was willing to go ahead and follow along as I tried to stay in line with my moral compass. I feel really lucky to have always had the kind of people placed in my life that I needed to stay on the right track. Not only that, but to always have someone around me that I felt close to. Having these types of relationships have always been super important to me.
        </p><p>Logan and I went through all kinds of different phases as to what we interested in. In middle school it was all about playing sports. There were a lot of kids withing a few years of our ages in the neighborhood, so we were always putting together pick-up games of baseball, basketball, football, soccer or whatever else. I also remember hanging with these kids who had a trampoline with walls around the edges to keep you from falling out, so we'd have crazy royal rumble wrestling matches. A couple times we organized sports “leagues” with all the kids where we would put together teams and keep track of stats and win-loss records. Besides baseball I didn't play a lot of organized sports, but their was always plenty going on in the neighborhood to keep me busy.
        </p><p>Some of my favorite memories with Logan were the sleepovers we'd have nearly every weekend, which as middle schoolers we coined the more mature sounding “spending the night.” We did all the things you'd expect from most middle school age kids: play video games, watch movies, and eat pizza and other junk food into all hours of the night. Logan introduced me to lots of Adam Sandler and Jim Carrey movies, and lots of dumb action movies that embarrassed to say I was so excited about at the time. We went through lots of phases with our video games as well, we played racing games like Need for Speed,  Grand Turismo and Tokyo Extreme Racer, sports games like Madden NFL and NHL 2000, the extreme sports games from Dave Mirra and Tony Hawk, and of course shooters like Metal Gear Solid and Halo.
        </p><p>Another big phase for us at the time was Pokemon. Everyone I knew owned the gameboy games and would collect the cards. It started small with a little stack that a friend gave to me and my younger brother and sister, but before long we had binders full of them. Some of us in the neighborhood but together Pokemon card tournaments where we would battle to become the champion of certain Pokemon “types” like fire, water, or ice. We created 8 little badges for each type, and would challenge each other to become the new champion. Pokemon faded out as we got into high school, but for quite a while they were huge.
        </p><p>Also this year I hit a spiritual milestone. On May 28th, 2000 I was ordained to the office of a deacon in the Aaronic priesthood by my father. To me this was the real sign of becoming older, and I enjoyed the responsibility of administering the sacrament to the congregation each Sunday. I made it a point to become very knowledgable about each deacon's job while passing, and become a master of all the little techniques to pass the trays around as quickly and efficiently as possible.
