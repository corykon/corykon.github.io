<h3>Sophomore Year (03'-04' - Age 15)</h3>
        <p>I entered my sophomore year with a 4.0 gpa, and did just about as well in my classes this year, with one exception: a science class taught by the notorious Mrs. Waterworth. She was a hilarious lady, kind of seemed a little crazy, and she was ruthless with her class. As I look back on it now it doesn't seem like she asked that much of us, but compared to anything else I had done before it sure seemed like a whole lot. Tests were longer and harder than anything I'd experienced, and she gave more homework, including lots of large projects. For whatever I lacked the motivation to buckle down and perform, so I ended up with a C in her class. I was frustrated with the result, and vowed not to let it happen again.
        </p><p>In the tenth grade I had my first experience of heartbreak over a girl, a young lady that was being adopted by family in my ward at church. She had lived with the family as a foster child for a couple of years, and we had liked each other on and off throughout that time, and I wanted to start dating her when we both turned 16. Through a nasty series of events the family faced ran into some complications during the adoption process, and she was sent back to live with her biological mother.
        </p><p>It was also during this year that I started to grow my hair out, basically just as part of the skateboarder fad. It took 4 or 5 months to grow out, and I ended up keeping it that way until after I graduated from high school. To be honest it really looked pretty horrible, just a big messy mop that was always in my face, but I loved having it. I would almost constantly be wearing a hat or a beanie, and I liked it would sort of flip up and out my hat. Definitely not a good look for me, but I didn't care too much.
        </p><p>This year we had another awesome Youth Conference, held on the campus of Frosburg University. The event seemed a lot bigger than year than it had before, and it was really exciting to get to stay up in the dorms. The classes, activities and dances were all great, and we had a lot of extra free time to just hang out with friends. I spent a lot of time with Josh Menendez, Luke Fullmer, and bunch of other kids in the stake that I hadn't met before. I remember all of us brought our skateboards, and there were tons of good spots to skate around the campus. They even had a small skatepark just a few blocks away, and we got to go and help the owner of the park perform some maintenance on one of the ramps. Throughout the conference we carried a small video camera around with us, and after it was all through we put together a skateboard video from just that conference.
        </p><p>Skateboarding was still a huge passion for me this year, and Josh and I were always looking for new things to try. At the time there weren't any skateparks around, so we became pretty industrious and tried to build our own stuff. We didn't have a lot of money or resources, but we found ways to build ramps and boxes out of old wood scraps. There was a lot of residential construction going on where we lived, so we found this huge dump back behind one of the neighborhoods that was chock full of usable materials. Josh and I would sit down and brainstorm the types of ramps or rails we needed to learn some new tricks, then we'd draw out a design and figure out all of the pieces we would need. Sometimes it took some good digging, but one way or another we'd be able to pull together enough to get the job done. We probably never spent more than a couple bucks on the dozens of skate ramps that we built over the years.
        </p><p>Easily the most exciting moment of my sophomore year was purchasing a drumset. I had been begging my parents to let me get a drumset for years to no avail. It was either too expensive, too loud, too large to fit anywhere in the house, or just a passing phase that wouldn't be worth the investment even if I had the money. To try and prove my sincerity, one summer in middle school I actually built my own drumset in the shed out of few different sized buckets I collected, including a giant storage barrel for a basedrum, and home crafted, spring-loaded base drum pedal. Finally on my 16th birthday, which was at the tail end of th second semester of my sophomore year, the right opportunity presented itself. I switched into a phys ed class with my friend Andrew Fultz, and he mentioned that he had a drumset that had been collecting dust in his bedroom, so he was willing to let it go for cheap. I gathered together my savings and birthday money and was able to talk him down to the amount that I had. Because it was my birthday I think he decided to be extra charitable.
        </p><p>I was brimming with anticipation as he hopped in his truck after school to go and pick it up. It was a deep blue, 5 piece no name drumkit with cheap die-cast cymbals, and it was badly in need of some tuning, but it was mine and I loved it. I happily handed over the wad of cash and bag full of coins, and then we carefully loaded each piece into his truck bed and drove to my house. Upon arriving we carried the set up into the humid little room above the garage, and then my dad, who had also been a drummer in high school, helped us to set everything up. I remember sitting down onto the padded stool that first time, putting my bucket honed skills to work. I couldn't play much, but it felt great. I played for a couple hours that night—the first of many throughout the next few years.
