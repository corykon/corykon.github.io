        <h3>First Grade (94'-95' - Age 6)</h3>
        <p>My first grade teacher was Mrs. Pinelli, I remember my older sister Taylee had her as a teacher as well, so I had met her before and was excited to have her as my teacher. Part way through the year she was married, and so her name changed to Mrs. Bocage. One of my favorite thing in this class was to use the computers; this was back when most programs just ran in sort of a DOS environment, or possibly an older Macintosh computer. We didn't use the Windows operating system in school for quite awhile. Sometimes our assignment on the computer would just be to use the word processor program, and we were allowed to write whatever we wanted, and then we could have it printed out. I would always try to write the longest “essay” in the class, which really was no longer than just a few sentences, but I would be so proud when the teacher would say “Wow Cory, someday you could be a writer!”
        </p><p>It was around this time that I started to make my first friends in the neighborhood I lived in. Just a few doors up the hill I had a friend named Josh Newell, across the street were the Keefer's, who had a daughter my age named Christina, and then there were the twins who were a year younger that I played with quite a bit. One of my favorite things to do at the twins home was to play video games, because we didn't own a video game console at my home until years later. They had a Sega Genesis, so we'd play Sonic the Hedgehog, The Incredible Hulk, and probably a few other games.
        </p><p>I know that I spent a good bit of time playing with Josh Newell, and there was one instance when we wanted to go play in his backyard, but because of the way the fence was set up, the only way to get to it was by walking through the house. For a while when I was younger my parents had this rule that I wasn't supposed to go into another person's house unless they knew about it and had given me permission, and so being the classic obedient child that I was, this caused a bit of a problem. Josh's mother assured me that it was just fine that I run across the kitchen to get to the backyard, but I refused to go through. She was pretty well shocked, and had to call my mom on the phone before I would agree to come through the door.
        </p><p>As I mentioned earlier, my older sister and I always had very busy imaginations, and we loved doing creative and constructive types of things. Taylee has always been a good artist, and she would work with me step by step to teach me how to draw certain animals or objects, and so it would have been around this age, when I had started becoming more comfortable with reading and writing, that she and I started writing our own little book series. It was about the adventures of group of friends who were animals, and I there was an elephant, a monkey, a couple tigers, a flamingo, and probably a few others, and we also created a few “badguy” animals as well. We mapped all of their names and personalities and organized it into a little booklet, and then would write bunches of short stories about, and we also created a movie-length storyline called “To the Border,” which was about them escaping from poachers. This little project was among the first of many creative endeavors; I always loved working on these types of things.
        </p><p>Some of my favorite types of projects as a kid were done using the computer. We bought our first computer sometime around 93', and if I remember right it was running Windows 3.0. I first used it just for playing games, and hours were spent playing them. Some of my favorites were Chip's Challenge, tic-tac-drop, Rattler's Race, and Mouse Hunt. We also had a copy of the Microsoft Office suite, which included the Publisher program. I think that I first discovered this program when my parents showed me that it had paper airplane templates. It would print out a sheet of paper with cool designs that would line up just right as you made the plane and had dotted lines to show you exactly where to fold, and then also another sheet that included written instructions. I can't remember exactly how or when I discovered this, but later on I found that there were lots of other templates you could chose from, and I ended up stumbling upon the newsletter wizard. Every few weeks or so I would create edition of the Fugate Newsletter, and fill it up with little articles about what was going on, or just make up stories.
