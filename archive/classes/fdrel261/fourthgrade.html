<h3>Fourth Grade (97'-98' - Age 9)</h3>
        <p>As far as I can remember, things in the fourth grade didn't change a ton from the year before. My teacher this year was named Mr. Sherman, but for the life of me I can't remember what he looked like, or what type of personality he had. From others I've talked to, it sounds like he was kind of a grumpy guy, so maybe that's why I've got no recollection of him.
        </p><p>A couple of my best friends in this class were Chris Butler and Jose Garcia, and I remember that we'd always team up and play sports together during recess. More often then we'd go play soccer down at the far end of the playground. Our school had a couple soccer fields with full size nets, so for me that was definitely the place to be. Tons of kids would want to play, so we'd end with huge games, to the point where there'd be a lot more players on the field then there ought to be, but none of us really ever minded.
        </p><p>The only thing that I can remember about this class was the plus-one coupon system that Mr. Sherman used. He would hand them out for all sort of different things, whether it be good behavior,  answering a tough question, winning a game in class, or doing well on an assignment. We could use these plus one coupons to add up to five bonus point on any test, and then at the end of each quarter we could put all of them into a drawing to try and win some prize. Personally I would always save up my coupons and put them all in the drawing, but wasn't able to win anything during the first couple drawings. Chris, Jose and I came up with the idea that we would combine all of our coupons and put them in the drawing together, and then we would split whatever prize we won. By the end of the quarter we had gathered well over a hundred coupons, way more than anyone else in the class, and another student, who had only put in two or three coupons ended up winning. The three of us could hardly believe it, a whole quarter of saving coupons to no avail. Even still we certainly had a lot of fun collecting them.
        </p><p>I believe it was in the fourth grade when finally we bought our own video game console, and so this of course was a huge moment for me. I can hardly describe the excitement that bubbled within me as Dad, Taylee and I went to circuit city to go buy the Sony Playstation. We picked out a second controller, with the brand new all-directional analog sticks and vibration capabilities, and a couple of games as well. The obvious first pick for us was Crash Bandicoot, which we had played before at our cousin's home, the Fredette's, and then we also decided on a futuristic racing game called Jet Moto. Lots and lots of hours ended up spent with that Playstation, especially for the first few weeks after we bought it. Some really great memories during my elementary and middle school years were made as my brother and sisters and I worked together to try and beat a new game. We were able to strategize as to how we could best work together to get through the levels quickly, enjoyed the “triumphs” of beating a tough boss, and overall had an awesome together.
        </p><p>We'd also come up with lots of inside jokes as we played through some games. This was particularly true as we were all working together to play through a came called Croc. I can't remember the storyline, but you played as crocodile, and had to solve elaborate puzzles and fight off all kinds of unique enemies. This compared to others had tons more types of bad-guys than most, and some of them had really funny characteristics, so we started putting together a little book of all the different kinds of bad-guys we would encounter, giving them each a funny name and description. This was half the fun of that game; we'd play through levels and just seek out as many different types of characters as we could, and try to come up with goofy names for them.
        </p><p>As I had as I younger child, I continued to spend lots of time on the computer and started to become more and more comfortable working around in the Windows operating system, and the projects I got involved slowly started to become more elaborate. By this time we were working with Windows 98, our copy of the Microsoft Suite had been upgraded, and I now had the internet at my disposal. I started playing around with Microsoft Powerpoint, and I would build my own sort of slideshow movies with all of the animation and sound effect capabilities. At this age I had become a pretty die-hard Star Wars fan, and so most of my shows would be about those characters. I would download a whole bunch of Star Wars pictures and sound effects to incorporate, tell a story and write dialogue with the text on each slide, and then find ways to use the animations, transitions and sound affects to choreograph fight scenes and things. I came to thoroughly enjoy project likes this, where I could be creative and produce something that to me was cool. I loved being able take the understanding and the resources that I had available, and then stretch them and use them in new ways, to solve problems that I couldn't solve before.
