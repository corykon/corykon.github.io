<h3>Freshman Year (02'-03' - Age 14)</h3>
        <p>Finally the awkward days of middle school were over, but high school was a whole new animal to tame. I continued to be my shy and reserved self, and feel like I started to back out of the limelight even further as I got older. I always had my crew of friends to hang with and plenty of interests to keep me occupied, so while I feel like I probably missed out on some things in High School, I stayed busy and happy.
        </p><p>I attended the newly built Musselman High for all four years of my high school career. It was a much bigger and nicer school then what we had before, located just a couple minutes away from the middle school. I liked the freedom of having more choice over the classes I took, and decided to try out some computer programming classes. I absolutely loved them, and as dorky as it sounds, programming become a new passion for me during the next couple of years. I would spend hours outside of class trying new things and researching on the internet, and honestly started to become very good at it. We were taught to program in a very simple programming language called BASIC, so its capabilities were limited, but I found ways to push things. I had quickly mastered all of the procedural basics, and had become fairly proficient with graphics and building simple physics engines. During the middle of that year I built a platform game called shades, where you play as red circle dude with cool black sunglasses that had to battle evil square nerds. I even programmed these funny little cutscenes between each level that would tell a story about how you were trying to rescue your imprisoned people.
        </p><p>My final project that year was a skateboarding game; my crowning programming achievement up to that point. I designed a flashy opening title screen, which brought you to a menu where you could customize your skater's appearance and skateboarding style. There were 4 or 5 different tricks you do, including a couple flip tricks, an indy grab, and also nosegrind on any grind rail or trashcan. Your skater would ride through a series of screens with different rails, stairsets and other obstacles, and the program would keep score based on the tricks you were able to land. From what I hear my skateboarding game is still loaded onto the computers for all the programming students to see.

        <p>I believe it was in my Freshman year that I played my last season of baseball. I played that year and the previous one on the Orioles at South Berkeley's Junior League, which is one step after Little League. I never was especially good, but I loved it as much as I did when I was younger. I played centerfield, and sometimes I take over at second or third base. I was a pretty small kid, so definitely didn't have any power when I batted,  but I was quick and was often used as a pinch runner.
        </p><p>Freshman year I started attending early-morning seminary at 6:15am, which I always did faithfully, but getting myself out of bed was a struggle. Seminary during that year was held at the teacher's home, Sister McRoberts, which luckily was only a 2 minute drive away so I managed to squeeze in a couple more winks each morning. I feel like I always enjoyed it, and even I wasn't quite conscious enough to learn as much as I would have liked, I benefited from developing the commitment to go and do something hard that I knew was right. Since about the age of twelve I had been praying and reading my scriptures daily, and I'm confident that those things, along with starting my days with seminary helped a lot to keep my on the straight and narrow.
        </p><p>This year I almost made my next advancement in the priesthood by being ordained to the office of a teacher. As I had as a deacon, I stayed diligent in my priesthood responsibilities, and was always there to prepare the sacrament each Sunday morning, and was more than happy to help pass as well. If I remember right, at the time we had very few deacons in our ward, so I often had that opportunity.
        </p><p>Turning 14 also brings a couple of other changes for youth in the church; I was now able to attend the stake youth dances and Youth Conference. Being the reserved guy that I am I was never to fond of the dances, but I would attend them from time to time. I loved Youth Conference though, and I had a great time my first year. Most of that conference was just held up at the stake center in Winchester, and we had a bunch of activities and workshops in and around the building. What I remember most about conference that first year was the new friends that I made. After the activities were finished each day we would stay the night over at one of the member's homes that lived in the area. Tyler Keys and I both attended that year, and we were randomly chosen to stay with a kid named Lucas Fullmer. Lucas turned out to be a way cool kid; he had the craziest, funniest sense of humor. We stayed up way later than we should have both nights goofing off, but man was it fun. I can't remember half of what we did, probably just talking and joking most the night. It was great to hang with Lucas at Youth Conferences in years to come.
