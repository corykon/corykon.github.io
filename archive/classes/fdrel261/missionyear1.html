<h3>First Year Missionary Service (07'-08' - Age 19)</h3>
        <p>It wouldn't be difficult for me to write a novel about the experiences of my mission. In fact, I think I could write a whole series of books. One about the investigators I taught, one about things I learned about the gospel, another about the things I learned about life in general, and the ways that a mission transformed me as person. I could tell you about each area, each of my companions, the things I learned about being how to be a good missionary, and I could tell you about how to become proficient in the art of tie trading. I got several journals filled to the brimmed, and might even be able to fill a few more, but for the purpose of this history, I going to write just a fraction. I may expand it later, but for now I'll just say that a more exhausted history can be found by referring to my journals.
        </p>
        <h4>The MTC</h4>
        <p>I'll just say a tad about the MTC. First off, I've got to say it's a bit of an awkward place, especially at first. There a couple thousands kids from all different walks of life, with different levels of commitment to the gospel, and different levels of preparation for their mission. They're almost all nervous, scared, excited, a little homesick, and definitely all going through an intense period of adjustment. Its just an interesting combination of things. Even with all of that said, it's an amazing, spirit filled place. I struggled big time with homesickness and nervousness, and the stress caused me drop a few more pounds off my already skinny little frame, but I pushed through it, and I grew by leaps and bounds within the 2 weeks I spent there.
        </p><p>I was apart of MTD district 11-C, which was made up of 10 guys who were all heading to the Vegas mission. We were sort of an eclectic group with lots of different personalities; some stud athletes, smart but quiet guys, and definitely more than one were a little on the goofy side. I had excellent MTC teachers, Brother Wright and Sister Fielding. They were so good at focusing on our needs as an MTC group, and you could really tell they had a love for missionary work, and it rubbed off. It was a great experience, but after 2 and half weeks we were ready to get out of there and head down to Vegas.
        </p>
        <h4>First Area- Sandstone Stake in Las Vegas</h4>
        <p>My first area was in the Sandstone Stake of Las Vegas, covering the Westcliff and Palmhurst wards,  and my trainer was an excellent missionary by the name of Brandon Carlson from Muskegon, Michigan. He was exactly what I need in a first companion. I was nervous and a little unsure of myself, but I was determined to be obedient and improve. He unassuming and patient with me, stuck to the missionary handbook, and we went and worked hard all day, every day. He was a great teacher, and took the time to work with me and teach me everything that he knew.
        </p><p>Our area was a bit on the humble side, so it was the perfect area to be broken in with contacting, tracting, and teaching, because people are in general more willing to slow down and take the time listen to you. We had excellent, supportive wards, a decent number of investigators, and ended up with 4 baptisms as a companionship.
        </p><p>After 2 transfers he was finished training me, and was transferred to another area in Vegas. My next companion was James Holden from Midland, Michigan, who had only been out for 6 months himself, and this was only his second area. He was another powerful and obedient missionary, and the two of us did great together. Your second companion on the mission is known as your “polisher,” and he did just that. He was excellent teacher who had a great knowledge of the scriptures as Elder Carlson did, but a very different style, so it was great for me to pull things from him and Carlson, and mix them into my own style of teaching. Most of my family would know him as my “twin” companion, because we are the same height and weight, and are both redheads. We continued to do very well in the area. As a companionship we didn't have any baptisms, but we worked our butts off, and we taught some great people, and gained a lot of trust from the members in our wards.
        </p><p>At the end of that transfer, Elder Holden was called to be the zone leader within our same zone, and I was called to be a district leader, and to train a new missionary. It just about knocked me off my feet, I remember barely sleeping the night we received our transfer calls. I had only been out for 4 and a half months, and suddenly had a whole heap of new responsibilities piled on top of me. My companion, or “son” as we call our trainees, was Nick Jones from Camdenton, Missouri. He was a hilarious kid; just a great sense of humor and was super chill. Most of the missionaries in my district were quite a bit older, but they were good guys, and they were willing to support me as I stretched into my new responsibilities. My confidence grew by leaps and bounds, and I continued to labor diligently in this area that I had come to love so much. I knew nearly every street by name, was friends with all our members, and just felt way more focused on the work, on my members and investigators rather than worrying about my shortcomings so much.
        </p><p>Elder Jones developed into a great missionary, and we were a powerful young team, likely because we were so inexperienced, and knew we had to rely on the Lord. Because of that, he more than made up for our weaknesses, and we had some amazing spiritual experiences. We baptized a family of three, a mother, Tina Brown, and her son and daughter Steven and Erikka. In our second transfer together we actually picked up a third ward, Evergreen, which was chock full of work to be done. When I left we literally had hundreds of names we were trying to keep track of, more than a dozen serious, progressing investigators, and I believe there were eight more baptisms the transfer after I left.
        </p>
        <h4>Second Area- Redrock Stake in Las Vegas</h4>
        <p>After training Elder Jones for 3 months, and spending a total of 7 ½ months in my first area, I was finally transferred. I went over to the Redrock Stake, which was actually just minutes away. My companion was Elder Casey Wright from Wasilla, Alaska,  and we served in the Summerlin, Hillpointe, and Redrock Singles Wards. It was only Elder Wright's second transfer, bet he did a decent job of helping to learn the area, which was extremely different than my first area despite its being so close. The singles ward spans across the entire stake, which covers and extremely well to do area. Missionary work is completely different in an area like this because of the way you interact with investigators and the members of your ward. Investigators are harder to come by, but tend to be more dependable when you can find them. Sometimes they require a lot more intellectual understanding before they will spiritually give things a try.
        </p><p>I spent only 6 weeks in the area, but Elder Wright and I had great success. We taught a lot of lessons, worked hard to keep up with the proselyting standard, and I personally learned a lot from working with such a different type of people. We enjoyed two baptism while I was there, and a full teaching pool with baptisms to come as I left.
        </p>
        <h4>Third Area- Reno North Stake in Reno</h4>
        <p>My next assignment, now that I'd been out for nearly 9 months was to serve as a Zone Leader with Jacob Wilcox, from Marysville, Washington, in the Reno North Zone. The eight hour drive up to Reno was exciting and nerve-racking at the same time. New responsibilities, new companion, new wards, all in a very new environment. As I've mentioned previously, I tend to be one who struggles with change, but the mission sure helped to get a little more used to it. Time after time I'd be ripped from what became comfortable and familiar, and sent something new, with a new pile of responsibility. Through the powerful catalyst of change, the heaps of new responsibility, and most importantly the constant engulfment and aide of the spirit of the Lord, it was like I had become a new person. Life before the mission literally felt like a past life. There are few times in your life when you can actually look back and see the development of your character, but a mission is one of those times.
        </p><p>One again, I was given an unbelievable companion. Elder Wilcox was an absolute spiritual giant, a man that I will always look up to as an example and great leader. He, like my past companions was so patient with me and my shortcomings. I'm not the type of person who wants to volunteer for the kind of leadership positions I was given, but he helped to show me how I could.
        </p><p>I loved this area in Reno. We covered a family ward, the Reno 1st ward, the University 2nd Ward, and also the Lake Tahoe ward, which we drove 45 minutes out to visit every 2 or 3 weeks. We worked with some great and faithful member in our wards, and I remember the singles ward being especially fun. Elder Wilcox and I did not have a baptism while were serving in the area, but we actually did have massive amount of success. It was slow during the first few weeks, but we're teaching huge number of lessons each week by the end of the transfer, and several investigators were either committed to be baptized, or close to it.
        </p><p>When Elder Harrison, who had been in my MTC group, was transferred in, the success continued for us. Elder Harrison, from Decatur, Texas, had become one of my best friends and a great mentor. He is a powerful leader, and like Elder Wilcox is someone I will always look up to. Elder Harrison an I worked our hearts out, and reached the proselyting standard of 10 hours of tracting and 70 contacts per missionary each week more than I had with any previous companion. We worked hard to encourage the missionaries in our Zone to do the same. We dealt with some difficult obedience issues at times, but we had a great group of missionaries in our zones, and had a lot of fun with them. As I served with Elder Harrison I felt that I started to become at least a bit more comfortable with some of my leadership responsibilities, but certainly had so much more to learn. In our two transfers together in Reno, I believe we had 8 baptisms, and several more followed that were a result of investigators that we found and taught.
