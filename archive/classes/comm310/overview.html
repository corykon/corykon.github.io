            <h2>Class Overview</h2>
            <p>As described in Brother Judkin's Syllabus, the purpose of this class is to teach students the basics
            of web design. We'll become familiar with a few different languages, including HTML, 
            CSS, and PHP. Also included will be discussions of SEO, usabilty, and the importance of following web 
            standards.</p>
            <p>As with all classes, the level of understanding and mastery students achieve will depend on the time
            and effort they are willing to give. Those who wish to become future web designers or developers will be able
            delve in as deep as they would like into their assignments and projects, and those who are just seeking to
            become acquainted with the world of online media creation will able to do so and be successful as well. I
            would encourage everyone to learn concepts as fully as they are able because online media is certainly
            becoming more and more prevalent, and so the ability to produce it will become an extremely
            valuable and marketable skill.</p>
            <h3>Class Flow/Structure</h3>
            <p>As of Winter 2011, the class is three days a week, twice as normal class/lecture time, and then
            once week as a lab. Participation plays a fairly large roll in class, so its is important to do as
            the Learning Model suggests, come prepared to class to teach other students, and look for opportunities
            to share what you learn out of class. Refer to the
            <a href="http://www.brotherjudkins.com/310/syllabus/schedule.php" title="Online schedule for COMM310">
                online schedule</a> to keep track of reading assignments, projects, and topics for lab days.</p>
            <p>Most assignments and quizzes are open book and open web, which
            is very much a real-world condition, because students' ability to understand principles and then
            comfortably use resources online is more important than just memorizing code. In real world situations,
            web designers will always have such resources available and will use them often. Memorization certainly
            helps and will come with practice, but by no means is memorization a requirement to be a successful web
            designer.</p>
            <h3>Materials Needed</h3>
            <p>The hard copy resource required (as of Winter 2010) is the HTML Dog book called: "The Best
            Practice Guide to XHTML & CSS. This book teaches concepts very simply and clearly, but just as often
            I would recommend refering to online resources when looking up code,because the HTML Dog book is
            becoming out of date. HTML 5 will very soon be the most current widely supported version of HTML, and
            CSS will soon complete its transition to version 3.</p>
            <p>It is also helpful to have some sort of code editor, such as Dreamweaver(which is super expensive),
            or NetBeans,TextWrangler(for Mac), or Notepad++(Windows). The later three are all free and relatively
            easy to use.</p>
            <h3>Keep Skills Polished</h3>
            <p>The web is a rapidly evolving world, so hopefully in this class students will learn how to use
            available resources to stay educated and up to date. A great way to do this is to ocassionaly visit
            web design blogs and other resources online. Some great sites for this are listed
