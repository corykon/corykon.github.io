        <p>Hyperlinks are really what make the internet so special. They allow you to click
        and then be transported to a new page. Without them, websites would just be big online
        books, we'd have to flip or scroll through until we found what we were looking for.
        On this page I'll explain the basic of creating hyperlinks with HTML.</p>
        <p>Hyperlinks are created using the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag, which stands for
            &quot;anchor&quot;. Within this html tag there are two attributes which should
            be included, the <code>href</code> or &quot;hyperlink reference&quot; and the
            <code>title</code> attribute. The <code>href</code> attribute is used to specify
            the location where the link should take you, and the <code>title</code> attributes
            basically explains where the link takes you. The <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> will be
            wrapped around the text or image you would like to serve as the link, in this
            manner:</p>

        <pre><code>

&lt;a href=&quot;/path/path.html&quot; title=&quot;Link Title&quot;&gt;This text will be a link. &lt;/a&gt;

</code></pre>

        <p>Again, the <code>href</code> specifies the path this link will follow, whether
        that be to another page, a location within the same page, or to a particular file. The
        <code>title</code> attribute explain the link. As you hover over a link, the title
        will be displayed, sort of like a tooltip.</p>
        <p>Paths in in the <code>href</code> attribute can be absolute or relative.
        Absolute paths begin with the &quot;/&quot; symbol, which means "go back to
        the root of this webpage's file structure. Without that symbol, the path is
        assumed as being relative to the location of the file you are currently on.</p>
