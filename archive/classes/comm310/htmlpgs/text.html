        <p>After pinning down the fundamental HTML &quot;filing cabinet&quot;, it's time
        to move on to the markup for you text. Text is the real meat of a webpage; amidst
        the flashy images and cool css design, the actual text, the content you deliver
        is more often then not what your user have really come to see. Improper markup will make
        it different for them to read and understand, and will also make it difficult for them
        to find, as search engines are beginning to rely more and more heavily on the way 
        you mark things up.</p>
        <p>I'll cover the most commonly used tags here, which allow you to create paragraphs,
        empahasize particular words, create headings, and create lists. There are many other types
        of text markup, including abbreviations, acronyms, addresses, quotes, and others. I'd encourage
        you to refer the HTML dog text book, and other sources for more information on these.</p>

        <ul>
            
            <li><a href="#paragraph" title="Paragraph Tag">Paragraph Tag</a></li>
            <li><a href="#emstrong" title="Emphasis and Strong">Emphasis and Strong</a></li>
            <li><a href="#headings" title="Headings">Headings</a></li>
            <li><a href="#list" title="list">Lists</a></li>

                
        </ul>

        <h3 id="paragraph">The Paragraph Tag</h3>
        <p>We'll start with the paragraph tag. Simply put, the paragraph tags are placed around
            anything that is a paragraph. For example, this chunk of text you're reading right now.
            It's been wrapped in opening (<code>&lt;p&gt;</code>) and closing (<code>&lt;/p&gt;</code>)
            paragraph tags...because it's a paragraph. If the
            chunk of text you're marking up isn't a paragraph, then don't wrap it in paragraph tags. If
            you want to insert a picture into your page, don't wrap it in paragraph tags either. Unless
             of course it's part of a paragraph. Some new designers go a little crazy and wrap everything
            with p tags. Don't do that. Here's a correct example of using paragraph tags:</p>
       
        <pre><code>

&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph. It is in between the paragraph tags.
    Isn't it fantastic? &lt;/p&gt;

</code></pre>

        <p><em>Remember:</em> By default, paragraphs have a certain amount of padding or space
            above/below them. This can be changed w/ css.</p>

        
        <p class="totop"><a href="#top" title="To top of page">Back to Top</a></p>
        

        <h3 id="emstrong">Emphasis and Strong</h3>
        <p>The emphasis and strong tags are used to add a little extra <strong><em>umph</em></strong>
            to a word or phrase. (I added both the <code>strong</code> and <code>em</code> tags around
            the word &quot;umph&quot;. By default these tags make the text look a little difference, but when talking
            about HTML, the point is that the words or phrases literally <em>mean</em> more to the browser, which means
            they also mean more to the search engine. Here's and example of the code:</p>
        <pre><code>


    &lt;p&gt;I want &lt;em&gt; emphasis &lt;/em&gt; and &lt;strong&gt; strength &lt;/strong&gt;
       in this paragraph.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lots of it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

</code></pre>
        <p><em>Remember:</em> When html tags are nested, they inner tags need to be closed before
        outer tags, as is shown above. (i.e. - the paragraph closing tag comes after the strong and
        emphasis tags because it opened first. It is the &quot;outer&quot; or &quot;parent&quot;
        element.</p>

        <p class="totop"><a href="#top" title="To top of page">Back to Top</a></p>

        <h3 id="headings">Headings</h3>
        <p>Heading tags are used to identify headings, such as the word &quot;Headings&quot; up above
        this paragraph. Headings come in 6 preset sizes, 1 being the most important, and 6 the least.
        By deafault, your browser will display that at different sizes, but these can be altered
        with css. Here's how you use them:</p>
        <pre><code>
&lt;h1&gt;This is the most important heading&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;This is the second most important heading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/h6&gt;This is the least important.&lt;/h6&gt;

</code></pre>

        <p><em>Remember:</em> Headings by default will take up an entire line.
        </p>
        <p class="totop"><a href="#top" title="To top of page">Back to Top</a></p>

        <h3 id="lists">Lists</h3>
        <p>There are three types of lists in html:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>ordered lists</li>
            <li>unordered lists</li>
            <li>definition lists</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Order lists should be used when the information you're
        displaying needs to be in a particular order, such as a list of chronological steps to
        complete. By default ordered lists show up with numbers. Unordered lists, like the one above,
        should be used when lists have no chronological order. By default these lists are bulleted.
        Definition lists should be used when defining words, so to be honest you may or may not
        use it quite so often. Following is an example of the code for an unordered list. To use
        an ordered list, simply substitue &quot;ol&quot; for &quot;ul&quot;. To use a definition list,
        substitute &quot;dl&quot; for &quot;ul&quot; and then use &quot;dt&quot; for the term to be
        defined and &quot;dd&quot; for the definitions of that term.</p>
        <pre><code>
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;List item 1&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;List item 2&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;List item 3&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;List item 4&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


</code></pre>

    <p><em>Remember:</em> Lists can be nested, this can create some nifty results when using
        lists for hyperlinks. The navigation at the top of my pages were created using
        nested unordered lists and some css.<br></p>
