            <h2>HTML Basics</h2>
            <p>As you begin to create your first HTML page, it is important to start with the basic "filing cabinet"
                structure. To begin, each page needs to start with a <code>DOCTYPE</code> declaration. This basically
                tells the browser which version of HTML you are using. For this example I will use an HTML 5 declaration.
                HTML is not yet fully supported, but soon will be. The <code>DOCTYPE</code> MUST be the first line of the
                page; not even a single space ought to be before it. It is just a single line, and looks like this:</p>
              <pre><code>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;



</code></pre>
            <p>It is as simple as that. In previous versions of HTML, much longer declarations (including mile-long, impossible
            to remember URL's) were required.</p>
            <p>The next step is to layout the before-mentioned HTML "filing cabinet." Following the <code>
            DOCTYPE</code> you'll use an <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tag to let the browser know that the actual html
            markup is beggining. Inside of the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> opening and closing tag, there will be
            <span title="one HTML tag that is inside of another HTML tag is 'nested' within it">"nested"</span>
            <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tags as follows: </p>
           <pre><code>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;

    &lt;head&gt;

    &lt;/head&gt;

    &lt;body&gt;

    &lt;/body&gt;

&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
            <p>If you were to copy and paste that code into an HTML file and view it in a browser, you would see
            absolutely nothing(unless you view the source code), but that in and of it's self is basically
            a valid HTML page.</p>
            <p>To further explain these tags, the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tags will contain information about
            the webpage that is not seen in the browser window, such as the title that you see on the top of the tab,
            links ot other files used by the webpage, or information about the author or content of the page. In the
            <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> you'll throw in all the code that that will actually be seen in the browser window.
            To learn about some of the HTML tags needed to starting add some real content to your page, refer to
            future tutorials on this webpge, or another great resource such as HTML Dog or
