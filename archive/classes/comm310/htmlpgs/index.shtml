            <h2>HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)</h2>
            <p>HTML is where writing code for the internet begins. It is used to create the basic structure of a webpage-
            not from a presentation standpoint, but from the content/functionality side of things. <strong>Hyper</strong> 
            essentially means "linkable." HTML is what enables one page to link to another. <strong>Markup</strong> refers 
            to HTML's ability to apply meaning to text, you can use it to tell the browser that certain text is a
            title, or that it is more important than other text, or any other number of things.</p>
            <h3 id="contentVSpres">Content Vs. Presentation</h3>
            <p>This is one of the most important principles taught in the class&ndash; HTML is primarily used for
            giving a website content and structure, while CSS is used for the presentation and appearance of the
            webpage. The HTML Dog textbook stresses this principle early on, probably in a much clearer manner than
            I can, so to quote a portion of its explanation:</p>
            <blockquote>"HTML is for one thing and CSS is for the other&ndash; HTML should be used solely to construct
                content and CSS should be solely to present it."</blockquote>
            <p>The point was further illustrated in this manner:</p>
            <p id="superem"> <em >HTML = Content</em></p>
            <p id="superem"> <em >CSS = Presentation</em></p>
