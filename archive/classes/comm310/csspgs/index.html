            <h2>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</h2>
            <p>CSS is used to make websites pretty (or not pretty, if that's the way you want it). It works
                hand and hand with the HTML, and is used solely to produce the look of the webpage. As explained a
                bit more fully in the <a href="../htmlpgs/index.html#contentVSprs" title="Content VS. Presentation">
                HTML index page</a>, HTML is for content, and CSS is for presentation.</p>
            <p>CSS has been around for over ten years, but has only been widely adopted more recently. Before,
            HTML was used for producing both content and presentation. To some, having just one language instead
            of two may seem simpler, but in the end, using HTML for both aspects can seriously slow you down. For
            example, say you've built a HUGE webpage, with something like 1,000 seperate pages, and then you decide
            that you don't like the way the font looks. You likely we need to go and make that change 1,000 times, but
            with CSS you can just change it once, and all is well.</p>
