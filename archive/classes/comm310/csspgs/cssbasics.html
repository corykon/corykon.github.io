            <h2>CSS Basics</h2>
            <p>Although CSS works hand and hand with the HTML of a web page, its syntax is completely different. It
                is made up three major parts, namely <em>selectors</em>, <em>properties</em>, and <em>values</em>. These three together are what is
                called a CSS <em>rule</em>. The following would be an example of a standard CSS rule, with one selector,
                property, and value:
            </p>
              <pre><code>
p {text-size: 1em;}



</code></pre>
            <p>It the preceding example, <code>p</code> is the selector. This tells the browser that the <code>
            &lt;p&gt;</code> in the linked HTML page is what is being targeted for some styling. The <code>
            text-size:</code> portion of this rule is the property. The particular property as you can probably guess
                gives you the ability to change the zie of the text in that HTML paragraph. Finally, <code>1em</code>
                is the value. (An <em>em</em> is a relative typography measurement). The text in the paragraph
                tags of the linked HTML page will be displayed at a size of 1 em.</p>
            <p> Make a special note of the colon placed between the property and value. This must be present for the CSS to
                work. An equals sign, or any other symbol will not work. Also, remember not to forget the semicolon which
                follows the value. In a singe property rule it will not cause problems, but if there are multiple properties
                in the rule, the browser will not properly interpret your CSS.</p>

           <!-- <h3>CSS Selectors</h3>
            <p> There are dozens of different properties to be learned, and some of those will be introduced in future tutorials,
                but what I would like to cover here are some of the basic types of selectors that can be used.</p>
            <p>The first type of CSS selector is an HTML selector. This... </p>
