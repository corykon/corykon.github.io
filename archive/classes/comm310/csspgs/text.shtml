            <h2>Styling Text with CSS</h2>
            <p>Once you've got the the text of your webpage all beautifully marked up with HTML, you're
                ready to make it look good with CSS. On this page I'll cover the basic properties used when
                altering the appearance of your text.
            </p>

            <ul id="top">
                <li><a href="#fontfam" title="Font Family">Font Family</a></li>
                <li><a href="#fontsize" title="Font Size">Font Size</a></li>
                <li><a href="#color" title="Color">Color</a></li>
                <li><a href="#fontweight" title="Font Weight">Font Weight</a></li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="fontfam">The Font-Family Property</h3>
            <p>The <code>font-family</code> property is used to change the font that the
                text will be displayed in. You can choose any font you would like, but
                the user visiting the page must have the font on his or her own computer.
                As a safegaurd, its a good idea to use a number of fonts, seperated by commas.
                The browser will try the first font, and if finds that the user doesn't have that
                font, it'll move onto the next. It's a good idea to use a generic term, such as
                &quot;sans-serif&quot; &quot;serif&quot; as the last font, and the browser will
                just a default font. Here is an example, assuming we wanted to apply a font to a
                <code>p</code> tag.</p>

            <pre><code>

p {
    font-family: Crimson, Georgia, 'Times New Roman', sans-serif;
}

</code></pre>
            <p>Note: Fonts names with multiple words need to be in single quotes.</p>
            <p class="totop"><a href="#top" title="To top of page">Back to Top</a></p>


            <h3 id="fontsize">The Font-Size Property</h3>
            <p>As I'm sure you've guessed, this property is used to change the size
            of text. You can set the size in a few different units, but I'd recommend
            sticking with ems or plain old pixels. You can find a detailed description of
            these units and others <a href="http://kyleschaeffer.com/best-practices/css-font-size-em-vs-px-vs-pt-vs/"
                     title="Awesome Fontsize Unit Description" >here</a></p>
                     <p>Here's an example of the font-size property in action:</p>

            <pre><code>

h1 {
    font-size: 2em;
}

</code></pre>
        <p class="totop"><a href="#top" title="To top of page">Back to Top</a></p>


            <h3 id="color">The Color Property</h3>
            <p>This property is used to change the color of the text. There are few ways
                you can select the color you'd like to use, but the most common or the hexadecimal
                color code or color name. You can only use a color name for the most common of colors,
                like read, blue, white black, aqua, and few others. Hexadecimal codes can found online
                on dozens of different websites. I'd recommend downloading the ColorZilla add on for
                Firefox to help with as well. Here is the color property in action:</p>

            <pre><code>

h1 {
    color: blue;
}

p {
    color: #C00000;
}

</code></pre>
            <p class="totop"><a href="#top" title="To top of page">Back to Top</a></p>


            <h3 id="fontweight">The Font-Weight Property</h3>
            <p>The font-weight property is used to change the thickness of the text. There are
                a few different options with this, but I typically only use bold or normal. You can
                also use &quot;bolder&quot;, &quot;lighter&quot;, or a multiple of 100 from
            100-900, where 400 is normal and 700 is bold. This property is used as follows:</p>

            <pre><code>

h1 {
    font-weight: bold;
}

</code></pre>

            <p class="totop"><a href="#top" title="To top of page">Back to Top</a></p>
