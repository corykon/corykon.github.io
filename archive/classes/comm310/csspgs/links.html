            <h2>Styling Links with CSS</h2>
            <p>Hyperlinks can be style by the same css properties explained in the <a href="text.html" title="Styling Text wit CSS">
                    text</a> section, but there are a few points specific to hyperlinks that I'd like to explain here.
                    First of all, you need to be aware that the css styling of font-color applied to a paragraph
                    will not apply to the hyperlinks within that paragraph, because by default hyperlinks are blue. Similarly,
                    the default underlining can be removed with css applied to the paragraph tag. CSS for hyperlinks needs to
                    be applied to the <code>&lt;a&gt;<code> tag itself.
            </p>
            <p>The most important concept to learn when styling hyperlinks is that they can exist in four different
            states. Here they are with their associated psuedo classes, which we'll discuss in a minute:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Normal - a:<strong>link</strong></li>
                <li>Visited - a:<strong>visited</strong></li>
                <li>Hover - a:<strong>hover</strong></li>
                <li>Active - a:<strong>active</strong></li>

            </ul>
            <p>A visited hyperlink is one that references a page the user has already visited, whether by clicking
            on that particular hyperlink, or visiting it by another means. By default, visited links are that
            <span style="color:purple">nasty purple</span>
            color. A hyperlink is in its hover state when the mouse roll's over it. Keeping that in mind, we can create
            cool rollover effets, like link colors changing or underlines appearing when a user rolls over your links. The active
            state is when a link is currently being clicked (or when browser considers the link &quot;in focus&quot;, so this state usually doesn't exist for long. Normal links
            are whenever the link isn't in any of the other three states. As mentioned, the default for a normal link
            is the <span style="color:blue">blue color</span> we're all used to seeing.</p>
            <p>After understanding the different hyperlink states, we can use CSS psuedo classes to create cool effects.
            Simply choose a style for normal links, apply that style using the <code>a:link</code> selector(or just
            <code>a</code>), and then decide how you want the link to look when its being hover over, and apply that
            style with the <code>a:hover</code> selector. I typically just apply the normal styling to the
            <code>a</code> rather than <code>a:link</code>, because apply style to <code>a</code> affects all
            link states, including the visited and active states. If you want those states different as well (which
            would be a good idea for the visited state, at least when the hyperlink is in the body of the text as
            opposed to the main navigation), then go ahead and do so.</p>
            <p>Here's an example of this in action. This is the css used to style the links in the body of
                this webpage:</p>
              <pre><code>

a{
	color: #0099cc;
	text-decoration:underline;
}


a:hover{
	color: #0080A6;
}


a:visited {
    color: #6dc7ec;

}


</code></pre>
