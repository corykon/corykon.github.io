        <h3 id="intro">Intro</h3>
        <p><strong>So, what is PHP?</strong> It's an open-source scripting language. <em>Open source</em>
        means that the materials used to create the language are completely free and open to the
        public, and <em>scripting</em> means it's a language that does not need to be precompiled to work;
        the code is just <q cite="http://www.webmonkey.com/2010/02/php_tutorial_for_beginners/">
        processed on the fly as necessary.</q></p>
        <p><strong>What does PHP do?</strong> It's used for the <strong>dynamic</strong> aspects of
        your website, the things that allow the user to really interact with the page. It can grab
        information that the user inputs into forms and use it in lots of various ways, it can
        change the look of a page based on the person viewing it, or even just based on the browser
        being used. Things such as blogs or discussions threads often use PHP to store and display
        user comments on a page.</p>
        <p>I think it is also important to note that PHP code is executed by a server, not by your
        browser. For this reason, when you are testing a PHP page on your local machine, you'll end
        up with a blank page if you try simply loading it up on a browser. You must be running a server on
        your computer, such as Apache, in order for the PHP statements to be executed. Most all hosts
        have some type of server running to interpret PHP</p>

        <h3 id="howtocode">How to Code</h3>
        <h4 id="basics">PHP Basics (code block, comments)</h4>
        <p>We'll start with how to begin and close a block of PHP code, and how to add
        comment to the code. Similar to html and javascript, PHP needs to be contained within
        an opening and closing "tag". Also comments can be used, which will be ignored by the server executing
        the code. Here is what this looks like:</p>
        <pre><code>
&lt;?php

    // This is a single line php comment

    #  This is also a single line comment

    /* This is a multiple

    *  line comment

    */
&gt;</code></pre>

        <p><em>Remember:</em> The opening
        and closing PHP "tags" must be exactly as displayed above, otherwise it will not be recognized
        as PHP. Also, be sure that the multi-line comment is closed, otherwise all the code located
        after the comment will be ignored.<br>

        <h4 id="variables">Variables</h4>
        <p>A variable is used to hold a value, kind of like a storage container, whether it be numbers,
            text, or boolean values. In many programming languages a variable type must be declared,
            but in PHP this is not necessary. Here is an example of the syntax for variables:</p>
        <pre><code>
&lt;?php

    $var = 'This is a variable';

    $another_var = 'This is another variable';

    echo '$var';

    // Will output:
    // This is a variable

?&gt;</code></pre>

        <p><em>Remember:</em> All variable names must start with a dollar sign ($), be one word
        (underscores can be used to separate multiple words), and no keywords can be used as
        variable names.<br>
