            <h2>PHP (PHP Hypertext Preprocessor)</h2>
            <p>PHP scripting language is what makes a webpage dynamic. It was oringally developed in 1995 by
            Rasmus Lerdorf as a set Perl web tools, but it didn't really come into a form similar to the it's
            current form until 1997. As you can see above, PHP is a "recursive" acronym, as the first letter
            "P" literally stands for PHP. Originally it stood for Personal Home Page, and since transformed into
            what it is today, so I suppose all together you could call it "Personal Home Page Hypertext
            Preprocessor. </p>
            <p>With all that said, PHP is basically a language that can manipulate the webpage based on the
            way the user interacts with it. As of yet we have yet to cover PHP in class, but below
            I've included a link that gives a rundown on all the basics of PHP. More informations, in smaller
            bits and pieces will be included in the future.</p>
