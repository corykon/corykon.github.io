        <h3 id="intro">Intro</h3>
        <p><strong>So, what is PHP?</strong> It's an open-source scripting language. <em>Open source</em>
        means that the materials used to create the language are completely free and open to the
        public, and <em>scripting</em> means it's a language that does not need to be precompiled to work;
        the code is just <q cite="http://www.webmonkey.com/2010/02/php_tutorial_for_beginners/">
        processed on the fly as necessary.</q></p>
        <p><strong>What does PHP do?</strong> It's used for the <strong>dynamic</strong> aspects of
        your website, the things that allow the user to really interact with the page. It can grab
        information that the user inputs into forms and use it in lots of various ways, it can
        change the look of a page based on the person viewing it, or even just based on the browser
        being used. Things such as blogs or discussions threads often use PHP to store and display
        user comments on a page.</p>
        <p>I think it is also important to note that PHP code is executed by a server, not by your
        browser. For this reason, when you are testing a PHP page on your local machine, you'll end
        up with a blank page if you try simply loading it up on a browser. You must be running a server on
        your computer, such as Apache, in order for the PHP statements to be executed. Most all hosts
        have some type of server running to interpret PHP</p>

        <h3 id="howtocode">How to Code</h3>
        <h4 id="basics">PHP Basics (code block, comments)</h4>
        <p>We'll start with how to begin and close a block of PHP code, and how to add
        comment to the code. Similar to html and javascript, PHP needs to be contained within
        an opening and closing "tag". Also comments can be used, which will be ignored by the server executing
        the code. Here is what this looks like:</p>
        <pre><code>
&lt;?php

    // This is a single line php comment

    #  This is also a single line comment

    /* This is a multiple

    *  line comment

    */
&gt;</code></pre>

        <p><em>Remember:</em> The opening
        and closing PHP "tags" must be exactly as displayed above, otherwise it will not be recognized
        as PHP. Also, be sure that the multi-line comment is closed, otherwise all the code located
        after the comment will be ignored.<br>

        <h4 id="variables">Variables</h4>
        <p>A variable is used to hold a value, kind of like a storage container, whether it be numbers,
            text, or boolean values. In many programming languages a variable type must be declared,
            but in PHP this is not necessary. Here is an example of the syntax for variables:</p>
        <pre><code>
&lt;?php

    $var = 'This is a variable';

    $another_var = 'This is another variable';

    echo '$var';

    echo '$another_var';

&gt;</code></pre>

        <p><em>Remember:</em> When using variables, it is important to always use the $ sign before the variable
            name. Variable names can include numbers and the underscore characters, but a
            letter has got to be the first character. Also, remember that PHP variable ARE
            case sensitive, so $VAR is not the same as $var.<br>

            WebMonkey's PHP tutorial</a></p>
        <p class="totop"><a href="#top" title="To top of page">Back to Top</a></p>

        <h4 id="strings">Strings - echo, print, single vs. double quotes</h4>
        <p>As was shown in the previous example, the echo command is one way to display
        strings onto the screen in PHP. The other way is to use the print command. Both
        commands use the exact same syntax. Here is an example of this:</p>
        <pre><code>
&lt;?php

    $var = 'Optimus Prime';

    echo 'My name is $var';

    echo "My name is $var";

&gt;</code></pre>

        <p><em>Remember:</em> It is possible to use both single and
            double quotes with the print and echo statement, and they yield different results.
            If you use double quotes, any variable name included will be expanded. In other words,
            the value contained in the variable, instead of the variable name, will be printed. If you
            use single quotes then the opposite is true, the variable name will be displayed on the screen.<br>

        <p class="totop"><a href="#top" title="To top of page">Back to Top</a></p>

        <h4 id="arraysN">Arrays (Numeric)</h4>
        <p>An array is simply a variable which can hold more than one value. It simplifies things when
        we need to hold a large number of values, because instead having to create a massive number of variables,
        we create just one that can hold a massive amount of values. The code to create arrays can be
        done a couple different ways:</p>
        <pre><code>
&lt;?php

    //like this:

    $classes = array ("CIT 320", "CIT 336", "CIT 330");

    //or like this:

    $classes2[] = "CIT 320";

    $classes2[] = "CIT 336";

    $classes2[] = "CIT 330";

    //here is how to reference a particular value in the array:

    echo "$classes[1];

&gt;</code></pre>

    <p><em>Remember:</em> When referencing a value in the array, the first location value will
        by default be 0. So if you would like to reference the third value you entered into the array,
        you would call for the value at location "2", not location "3".<br>

            WebMonkey's PHP tutorial</a></p>
    <p class="totop"><a href="#top" title="To top of page">Back to Top</a></p>

        <h4 id="arraysA">Arrays (Associative)</h4>
        <p>In an associative array, values are referenced by a name rather than by a numeric number. These
        names are specified by you, and can be a huge help in remembering which values are stored in which
        locations. Here are a couple examples of how this can work:</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;?php

    //like this:

    $meals = array(

        morning =&gt; "breakfast",

        afternoon=&gt; "lunch",

        evening=&gt; "dinner"
    );


    //or like this:

    $meals2[morning] = "breakfast";

    $meals2[afternoon] = "lunch";

    $meals2[evening] = "dinner";

    //here is how to reference a particular value in the array:

    echo "$classes[morning];

&gt;</code></pre>

    <p><em>Remember:</em> The rules mentioned for single and double quotes still apply here.
     Single quotes will create "literal" strings, and double quotes will retrieve variable values.<br>

    <p class="totop"><a href="#top" title="To top of page">Back to Top</a></p>

    <h4 id="arraysM">Arrays (Multidimensional)</h4>
    <p>Multidimensional arrays are basically arrays within arrays. You could think of an array as a table
    with one row, and a multidimensional array as table with multiple rows. Here is an example of the
    syntax for creating a multidimensional array:</p>

    <pre><code>
&lt;?php

    $food = array (

	        array ( name =&gt; "apple",

	                type =&gt; "fruit",

	                color =&gt; "red"),

	        array ( name =&gt; "carrot",

	                type =&gt; "vegetable",

	                color =&gt; "orange")
                      );
&gt;</code></pre>

    <p><em>Remember:</em>When referencing a value in a multidimensional array,
    you first refer to the "array within the array" by number, and then to the specific
    location in that array. (Like this "$food[1][name];")<br>

    <p class="totop"><a href="#top" title="To top of page">Back to Top</a></p>


    <h4 id="operators">Operators</h4>
    <p> Operators are used to perform operations on numbers, strings, and or variables such as
        arithmetic, assignment, or combining strings together. The operators in PHP are:
    <table>
        <tr><td>Assign</td><td> "="</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Add</td><td>"+"</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Subtract</td><td>"-"</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Multiply</td><td>"*"</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Divide</td><td>"/"</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Append(to combine strings)</td><td>"."</td></tr>
    </table>

    <p>An example of code using these operators:</p>
    
    <pre><code>
&lt;?php

   $var = 5 + 2 - 4 * 4 / 3;

   $var2 = "The answer is: ". $var;

    echo $var2;

&gt;</code></pre>

    <p><em>Remember:</em> Arithmetic in PHP will follow the normal order of operations,
    i.e. multiplication and division before addition and subtraction.<br>

    <p class="totop"><a href="#top" title="To top of page">Back to Top</a></p>

    <h4 id="operatorsC">Comparison Operator</h4>
    <p>Comparison operators are used in if-then type logic, and they return a boolean value
    of either true false. The comparison operators include the following:</p>
    <table>
        <tr><td>Equal to</td><td> "=="</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Identical to (meaning equal to AND the same type)</td><td>"==="</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Not equal to</td><td>"!=" or "&lt;&gt;"</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Greater than</td><td>"&gt;"</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Less than</td><td>"&lt;"</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Greater then or equal to</td><td>"&gt;="</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Less than or equal to</td><td>"&lt;="</td></tr>
    </table>

    <pre><code>
&lt;?php

   $booleanvar1 = 5 &gt; 1;

   $booleanvar2 = 5 &lt; 1;

   $booleanvar3 = 5 &gt;= 5;

   $booleanvar4 = 5 &lt;= 3;

   $booleanvar5 = 5 == 1;

&gt;</code></pre>

    <p><em>Remember:</em> Boolean values as held in a variable will be "0" for false and "1" for true.<br>

            WebMonkey's PHP tutorial</a></p>
    <p class="totop"><a href="#top" title="To top of page">Back to Top</a></p>

    <h4 id="operatorsL">Logical Operators</h4>
    <p>Logical operators are used to "string together" multiple comparison operators, as in most other procedural
    languages. Here is a table of their syntax, followed by example code.</p>

    <table>
        <tr><td>And</td><td> "&amp;"</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Or</td><td>"||"</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Not</td><td>"!"</td></tr>
    </table>
 <pre><code>
&lt;?php

   $booleanvar1 = !((5 &gt; 1) & (5 &lt; 6) || (4 &gt;= 3));

    //This expression would return false


&gt;</code></pre>

    <p><em>Remember:</em> <code>And</code> returns true only if both comparisons are true, while the <code>or</code>
    returns true as long as at least one of the comparisons is true.<br>
    Source: <a href="http://www.webmonkey.com/2010/02/php_tutorial_for_beginners/" title ="WebMonkey's PHP tutorial">
            WebMonkey's PHP tutorial</a></p>
    <p class="totop"><a href="#top" title="To top of page">Back to Top</a></p>

    <h4 id="conditional">Conditional Statements</h4>
    <p>Conditional Statements are what truly start to make web pages dynamic. They enable different pieces
        of code to be executed, based on things like user input, or possibly the time, or the type of browser
        currently being used. The <code>if</code> statement evaluates a variable or expression, and if it returns
        true, then a particular piece of code is executed. There also exists the <code>else</code> statement, which
        contains code to be executed if the expression returns false. Additionally, there is the <code>else if</code>
        statement, so you can run multiple comparisons. The <code>switch</code> statement provides the same type
        of functionality, but the syntax is optimized for a larger number of comparisons. Following are examples of
        the <code>if</code> and <code>switch</code> statements:</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;?php

   if ($var = 1){

        echo '$var equals 1';

   }else if ($var = 2){

        echo '$var equals 2';

   }else {

        echo '$var does not equal 1 or 2';

   }

   //Similar code could be written in this way with the switch statement:

    switch ($var) {

        case 1:

            echo '$var equals 1';

            break;

        case 2:

            echo '$var equals 2';

            break;

        default:

            echo '$var does not equal 1 or 2';

            break;
    }
&gt;</code></pre>

    <p><em>Remember:</em> The {} brackets need to surround the code that is dependent on a conditional
    statement while using the <code>if</code>, but they aren't needed with the <code>switch.</code><br>

    <p class="totop"><a href="#top" title="To top of page">Back to Top</a></p>

    <h4 id="loops">Loops</h4>
    <p>Loops can be an especially handy tool, because they allow the same piece of code to be rerun up to an
    infinite number of times, and can also act as "counters." Loops work using some type of conditional statement;
    as long as the statement returns true, the code within the loop will continue to be executed. There are a few types
    of loops, including <code>for, do, do while, and foreach</code>. Following are simple examples to show their
    syntax. (NOTE: the following code would not be fully functional, it is only to gives examples of syntax.)</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;?php


    //while loop

    while ($var &lt; 10){

        $var += 1;

        echo "$var";
    }



    //do while loop

    do{

        $var += 1;

        echo "$var";

    }while($var &lt; 10);


    //for loop

    for($var = 1, $var &lt; 10, $var++){

        $var += 1;

        echo "$var";

    }

    //for each loop (iterates through an array)

    $avar = array(1,2,3,17);

    foreach($avar as $v){

        echo "$v";

    }

&gt;</code></pre>

    <p><em>Remember:</em> Each of these loop types is useful in certain situations, evaluate each before
    deciding on which to use. Also take notice that variables used in while loops (as well as arrays in foreach loops)
    must be declared beforehand,but they CANNOT be declared before a for loop is used.<br>
