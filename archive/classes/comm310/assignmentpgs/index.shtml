            <h2>Assignments</h2>
            <p>Here are links to a couple of the major assigments we've worked on in Brother Judkins class. Feel
            free to use them for inspiration, and to view the source code.</p>
           	<h3>Project 1 & 4</h3>
           	<p>Your looking at it! For projects 1 and 4 we were to create a help website for future and current students
           	of taking this class. We created a "beta" version of the site for Project 1, an then
           	expanded it to include at least 12 pages during project 4.</p>
            <h3>Project 2: Big Juds Redesign</h3>
            <p>For this project we were to redesign the website for any local Rexburg restaurant. We were
            supposed to design something that would make you hungry. <a href="../bigjuds" title ="Big Jud's Redesign">
            View the site.</a> </p>    
 			<h3>Project 3: CSS Jurrasic Garden</h3>
            <p> For this assignment we were given the html code for the CSS Zen website, and had to create
            a css file based on a random theme. My theme words were "Jurrasic, Aqua, and Pocketwatch." 
            <a href="../csszen" title= "Css Zen assignment">View the site.</a>.</p>
