       <h1>Staff</h1>
        <br /><br />
        <p>Space Camp is staffed with an elite group of former NASA professionals, 
           many of whom are former astronauts who trained for and flew on both the 
           Space Shuttle and the International Space Station.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Each member of our coaching staff possesses at minimum a Master of Science
           degree, and many hold doctorates from prestigous universities throughout 
           the US.</p>
        <br />
        <p>We are committed to learning, and often send our staff members to various
           training sessions and conferences in order to stay current with the most
           recent developments in space exploration technology.</p>
        <br />
        <p><strong>We currently employ 25 full-time staff memebers, and typically hire an 
           additional 10-15 part-time employees during the busiest summer months.</strong></p>
        <br />
        <p>Our staff-to-camper ratio never exceeds 1:8, which means you will recieve 
           plenty of one-on-one time with our expert instructors.</p>
