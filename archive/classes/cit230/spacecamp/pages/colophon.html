       <h1>Colophon</h1>
       <p>The purpose of this page is to describe the efforts that have been made to
          insure that this website is as simple and user friendly as possible, as
          well as search enigine optimized. Also discussed are the efforts that have
          been made to insure a large ROI.</p><br />
            
         <h2>Web Standards</h2>
         <p>This webpage follows the current standards for XHTML and CSS code. This
            ensures that it will be viewable on all browsers,and on many different
            mediums, including computers, cell phones, and other devices.</p>

         <h2>Usability</h2>
         <p>Great efforts were made to ensure that this webpage is very simple and
            easy to use. The following lists some of the specific efforts to enhance
            navigation and clarity of content:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The names of links are simple and descriptive</li>
                <li>All links employ mousever effects, such as font changing colors or appearing arrows</li>
                <li>Links within the content section of the page are underlined</li>
                <li>The main navigation is just below the header, and secondary navigation 
                    is located on the left, common web standards</li>
                <li>Navigation is persistent, meaning it is the same on every page</li>
                <li>In the main navigation, the current pages link is underlined</li>
                <li>The name of each page is clearly displayed</li>
                <li>The names of pages correspond with their link</li>
                <li>Headings and titles are properly sized to ensure clear hierarchy
                    and scanability</li>
                <li>The design is stylish, but not overpowering. It doesn't cloud
                    the content.</li>
                <li>The purpose of each page is clearly defined</li>
                <li>Content is clear and concise</li>
            </ul>
         <h2>Search Engine Optimization(SEO)</h2>
         <p>SEO is ensured because of a clear hierarchy, "alt" and "title" being
            included in each link and image to increase the natural occurence of
            keywords.</p>
         <h2>Return On Investment(ROI)</h2>
         <p>While great efforts were made to ensure the usability, SEO, and strict
            adherence to web standards, relatively little money has been spent to
            do so. Space Camp is very in demand, so most potential particpants will
            seek out information on their own; not much marketing is needed. All on
            the Space Camp team will recieve proper pay checks, and Space Camp
            participants will recieve a quality experience for the price.</p>
