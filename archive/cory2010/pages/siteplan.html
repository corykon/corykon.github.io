    <h1>Site Plan</h1>
    <p>Just a rough plan for the design of this webpage.</p>
    <hr />
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Post my resume online</li>
        <li>Create a portfolio of work from my Visual Media Class </li>
        <li>To showcase my interests </li>
    </ul>

     <p> I would like potential employers to have this website as a resource to
        view both my resume and a portfolio of my work, and at the same time learn
        about my interests and personality so they cab be informed about
        the type of employee they would be hiring. This website will also be
        a place that friends and family can visit to learn about my interests and
        current projects.</p>
<hr />
    <h2>Audience</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Potential Employers</li>
        <li>Friends and Family</li>
    </ol>
    <p> My main audience is potential employers. In our current age, there are
        few fields if any which don't require some kind of CIT assistance, so
        this means I will need to develop this website for a very general
        audience. The content of the webpage will also be informative for friends,
        aquaintaces such as fellow students, and members of my family.</p>
 <hr />
    <h2>Why will people use this website?</h2>
    <p>Our nation is becoming an increasingly web-based socitey. More and more 
        social and work related networking, business, and even schooling are taking
        place online. It is almost becoming a necessity for us to be able to 
        contact or find information about others online. Those who wish to 
        connect with me, whether it be an employer, friend, or family will be able
        to use this webpage to do so.</p>
<hr />
    <h2>Other Websites Visited in Planning For My Own</h2>
    
    <dl>
        <dt>www.purevolume.com</dt>
        <dd> I like the format, very clean and stylish. I like the content. Lots
        of videos, music clips, and pictures that are easy to access.</dd>
        <dt>www.ultimate-guitar.com</dt>
        <dd> Again a very well done layout for the most part. The links are well
            organized, the site is easy to navigate. The homepage as lots of
            neat little boxes w/"big stories". I find the advertisements excesive
            and annoying though.</dd>
        <dt>www.drummerworld.com</dt>
        <dd> This is a relatively simple website. There aren't any crazy graphics
        or super intricate features, but its got tons of great information. I think
        the huge list of drummer names aligned in blocks is unique, kind of a cool
        way to show off how much work has been put into the site. Once again though,
        I think the huge amounts of ads are annoying, and they slow the webpage down
        quite a bit.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h2>Basic Site Components</h2>
