 <h3>What did I learn?</h3>
 <p>This week I spent some time going through a CSS tutorial, and learned quite a bit
     of useful stuff. I learned alot about specific tags, and also just
    about the power of CSS in general. It truly is a much more effective way to
    change the style of your page than anything that was available several years ago.
    The coding is fairly simple and logical on the service, but more advanced designers
    can also dive in very deep it create complex layouts. I still have tons to learn,
    but I was glad to begin picking up on some basics. </p>
 <p>There were a couple of things specifically that stood out as being very helpful
     to me that I'd like to mention in this report, one being the font-family element,
     and the other the "hyperlink hover" feature. I wanted to point out the font-family
     element because I noticed that after changing the font the feel of my website was 
     completely changed. It's such a simple thing to do that offers a very professional
     feel. The hyperlink hover element was also very neat to me, because it can replace
     several lines of javascript code with just a single line of css. These were just
     a couple of the multitude of amazing features.
 </p>

 <h3>How did I implement it?</h3>
 <p>In my own website I decided to use the Arial font, because I feel that the san-sarif
    font gives a very clean look to the site. In order to do this simply included the following 
    code in my css file:</p>
 <p>body {<br />
	font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, Sans-serif;<br />
        }</p>
 <p>I also wanted to have a simple rollover effect for my links in the footer. I formated
     the links to look like normal text, but when you rollover them they turn red. Again 
     the code was very simple, only a few lines: </p>
     
 <p>#footer a:hover{ <br />
	color: red;<br />
    }</p>
 <p> I still have lots of things to clean up in my site, but I'm excited to see what
     I'll be able to accomplish using CSS.</p>
