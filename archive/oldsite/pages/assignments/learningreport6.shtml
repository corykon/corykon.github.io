 <h3>What did I learn?</h3>
 <p>I decided that a good way for visitors of my website to be able to contact me would
    be through facebook, which we all know is one of the more powerful and mainstream 
    online social networks. Its something that people are very familiar with, and so
    users will feel comfortable making contact with me through this means.</p>
 <p> In the process of creating the link, I ran into some difficulties getting the 
     facebook icon to align correctly with the text, so I'll did some studying up on
     CSS image positioning. I found that I needed to used relative positioning so that
     I could position the image in relation to its parent &#60;div&#62; container.</p>
 <hr></hr>
 <h3>How did I implement it?</h3>
 <p>There are lots of different ways you could create a link to your facebook page, but I
     decided I want to create a tiny facebook icon in my footer's navigation section.
     The tutorial basically guides you to facebook's "Badge Widget Creator," which I
     referred to a bit(to find my profile pages URL), but I used other resources as well.
     I also went on google and found that there are lots of free neat little "facebook 
     buttons" to use. You can look around and find what suits you best, but
     <a href="http://www.justinparks.com/facebook-buttons-icons-badges-social-media/" title="Lots of Facebook buttons">
     here's the sight I grabbed my image from.</a></p>
     <p>Next I threw some simple html code into my footer module to create an
         image hyperlink, using the new image and also the URL I found on facebook's widget
         creator:</p>

     <p><em>&#60;a href="http://www.facebook.com/people/Cory-Fugate/100000152284103" title="Cory Fugate"&#62;<br />
      &#60;img src="/images/facebook.png" alt="facebook" /&#62;&#60;/a&#62;</em></p>
     <p>
     After creating the hyperlink, I found that the image wasn't aligning the way
     I wanted it to. Here's a screenshot of the problem I was having:</p>
    <p><img src="/oldsite/images/lr6example.gif" alt="Badly aligned icon"/></p>
    <p> As always seems to be the case, some fancy css came to the rescue. I stumbled 
      upon the help I needed on some discussion boards, but you can find better info about this on 
     <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/Css/css_positioning.asp" title="CSS positioning @ W3Schools">
         W3Schools</a>.</p>
    <p>Here's the code I used to fix the problem:</p>
    
    <p><em>
    <strong>#footer img{</strong><br />
    position: relative;<br />
    bottom: 8px;<br />
    left: 16px;<br />
    <strong>}</strong>
    </em></p>
    <p>That's pretty much the whole process. You can see the finished product
       in my footer at the bottom of each page.</p>
