 <h3>What did I learn?</h3>
 <p>This week I looked at some tutorials about using the meta tags. Meta tags have
    lots of different possible functions, but are in general are used to provide
    information about your webpage to the browser or search engines. The meta tags
    I would like to focus on are the description and keyword tags. </p>
 <p>The description and keyword tags are useful when optimizing your page for
     search engines. In the description tag you include a brief summary of what
     your page is about, and this would be used as the description that is seen
     under your websites name in the search engine. In the keyword tag you enter
     several words which when entered by someone into a search engine should flag
     your webpage as a relevant page. I was dissapointed to find that fewer search
     engines are now using these tags as part of their indexing process, there are
     still some that do, so it is useful to still include them.
 </p>

 <h3>How did I implement it?</h3>
 <p>The first step in implementing these meta tags is to develop a brief and concise
    description of the content and purpose of my webpage, and also to create a list
    of keywords which a person might use if they were looking for a webpage such as
    mine. For my page specifically, I don't that it would be extremely common for
    someone lloking for a resume to use a a search engine to find it, they would
    either already know of me andknow the web address, or would use a site like
    monster.com, but someone looking for a web designer would likely do that, so
    that is what I focused on when creating my keywords.</p>
 <p>After creating the list and description, these tags are simply placed in the 
     head section of your code:</p>
     <p>&#60; meta name="description" content="Insert you webpage Description here!" /&#62;</p>

     <p>&#60;meta name="keywords" content="Keyword1, Keyword2, Keyword3, Keyword4, Keyword5," /&#62;</p>
     <p>You can go to my home page and view the source code to see the description and
     keywords that I used for my webpage.</p>
