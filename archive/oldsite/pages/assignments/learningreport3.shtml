 <h2>Creating a Favicon</h2>
 <h3>Resource:<a href ="http://www.clickfire.com/favicon-tutorial/">

 <h3>What did I learn?</h3>
 <p>This week I decided to learn how to create my own favicon. I feel like there
     are quite a few good reasons for using one. First of all, having a favicon
     can work as a great source of extra adverting. The simple, tiny little logo will
     be saved and used if your page is bookmarked, and it will act as a reminder
     of your website whenever it is seen. I also think that it helps you to appear
     more professional. Although it is only a small touch, it is much better then
     default logo that a browser would display.</p>
 <p>After searching for a tutorial online, I found that creating a favicon is a fairly
     simple process. The first step is to create a tiny 16 x 16 pixel image. This is
     not too dificult, but there are tricks to creating more effective images. It
     is a good idea not too just shrink down a larger image because it will likely
     be distored, and it also a good idea to create a .png image so that you can
     have a transparent background. Once the image has been designed, you need to create
     it to an .ico file, and this can be done by using an online converter. Next you
     save it with the filenem "favicon," then upload it to your root folder, and
     insert one tiny piece of code into you site, and then you're done.
 </p>

 <h3>How did I implement it?</h3>
 <p>I decided that I would like a very simple logo, just my initials, "cf" in a couple
 different colors. I don't have programs such as photoshop or other adobe products,
 so I just messed around with paint and some other programs until I found something
 that I liked. Then I went to http://www.chami.com/html-kit/services/favicon/, where
 they a quick and easy to use favicon creator. You upload your image, and they produce
 a favicon.ico file, and also a favicon.gif if you would like to use an animated
 favicon. I decided to go with the .ico file.</p>
 <p>After that, you simply upload your file to the server, and then insert this 
     piece of code in the head section of your html file:</p>
 <p>&#60; link rel=”shortcut icon” href=”http://www.thenameofyoursitehere.com/favicon.ico” 
     mce_href=”http://www.thenameofyoursitehere.com/favicon.ico”/&#62;</p>

 <p>Overall it is a simple process, and the result is a more professional and polished
 website.</p>
