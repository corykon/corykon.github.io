 <h3>What did I learn?</h3>
 <p>This week I learned how to use CSS to highlight the link in your navigation that
    corresponds to your current location in the website. For example, if you look at
    the main navigation while on this page, you'll see that there is a red arrow
    pointing to the "assignments" link. I had known that there was some way to create
    this effect using CSS, but hadn't put in the time learn how to do so until our teacher
    Brother Roberston mentioned that he had just posted a couple video tutorials on this
    very topic.</p>
 <p>I feel like this really is a useful feature for a website, especially after reading
     through Steve Krug's <em>Don't Make Me Think</em> about web usability. He explains
     that as users feel comfortable and at ease using your webpage, their confidence in your
     ability to provide credible content increases. Something as simple as highlighting the
     link that corresponds with the current location helps add to the ease of navigation
     and sense of "place" on your webpage.</p>

 <h3>How did I implement it?</h3>
 <p>I had already learned how to
    <a href="/oldsite/pages/assignments/learningreport5.shtml" title="Learning report 5 @ coryfugate.com">
    create rollover effects in CSS</a>,so what I gleaned from the video tutorials was
    how to have the website "recognize" which page it is on. In order to do this, you have
    first have to specify a "class" in the &#60;body&#62; tag of each page.
    For example, in the HTML code for this page, I added this:</p>
 <p>&#60;body <strong>class = "assignments"</strong>&#62;</p>
 <p>Next, I used the "body class" to trigger the desired effect in CSS. In my webpage,
    I happened to use image sprites to have arrows point to links as the cursor hovers over
    them, so for me the desired CSS effect was to adjust the sprite so that the link with
    the arrow would be shown rather than plain link. So here is what my CSS code looked like:</p>
 <p>
 .home #homenav,<br />
.aboutme #aboutmenav,<br />
.interests #interestsnav,<br />
.resume #resumenav,<br />
.portfolio #portfolionav,<br />
.assignments #assignmentsnav,<br />
.contactme #contactmenav<br />
{<br />
 background-position: 0 -40px;<br />
 cursor: default;<br />
}<br />
 </p>
 <p>The <strong>.home</strong> piece of code refers to the class specified in the &#60;body&#62; tag,
    and <strong>#homenav</strong> refers to the id of the link in my navigation module.
    In this example you can see that I connected multiple selectors with commas, because the css
    code needed to produce the desired effect in each was the same.</p>
 <p>As for the css code within the curly braces, <strong>background-position: 0 -40px;</strong>
    adjusts the sprite so that the link with the arrow is displayed, and <strong>
    cursor: default;</strong> prevents the cursor from changing from the standard cursor to
    the "this is clickable!" cursor, further emphasing the concept that the user is already on
    the page that the link corresponds with.</p>
 <p>Once again, this is fairly simple process with a very beneficial effect. I will definitely
    be using this type of effect on all navigation schemes that I design.</p>
