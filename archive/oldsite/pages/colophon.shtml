        <h1>Colophon</h1>
        <p>The purpose of this page is to describe the efforts that have been made to
           insure that this website is as simple and user friendly as possible.</p><br />
            
         <h2>Navigation</h2>
         <p>The navigation in this webpage is very easy to identify and use, because it
             follows many common web standards: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The names of links are simple and descriptive</li>
                <li>All Links employ mousever effects, such as font changing colors or appearing arrows</li>
                <li>Links within the content section of the page are underlined</li>
                <li>The main navigation is just below the header, another common web standard</li>
                <li>Navigation is persistent, meaning it is the same on every page</li>
                <li>The main navigation has arrows indicating the current location</li>
            </ul>
         <h2>Headings/Titles</h2>
         <p>The name of each page is clearly displayed. It is located in the status bar,
            and in a large heading at the top left of the content section, which gives
            the user confidence as to which page they are currently on, and consequently
            helps with navigation. The headings of main pages match the links that correspond
            with them, further clarifying the navigation. Properly sized headings are used
            within the content in order to provide clearer visual hierarchy and greater
            organization, allowing for more "scanable" pages.</p>
         <h2>Simplicity</h2>
         <p>Overall this webpage has a very simple and clean design. There aren't a multitude
            of links, advertisments, pictures or clumps of other content pulling for your
            attention. You can very quickly scan the contents of the page without getting
            lost, and thereby quickly find what you're looking for.</p>
         <h2>Consistency</h2>
         <p>As with the navigation, elements of this webpage are consistent. The fonts,
            the logo, the colorscheme and layout remain the same throughout the website
            so that all the pages feel connected and unified. This is a very simple point, but
            without consistency, users feel like they are going to a completely different
            website each time they click on a link.</p>
