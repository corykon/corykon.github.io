    <h1>Style Guide</h1>
    <p>This guide will include a set of rules and standards for the design of the
    website as a whole. It serves as a reference to help maintain continuity amongst
    all the various pages. This will create for a more unified and usable webpage.</p><br />
        
    <h2>Page Dimensions/Orientation</h2>
    <p>The webpage will be designed using a fixed template that is 760px wide so
    as to fit within the smaller resolution screens, and to be around the
    optimum width for comfortable viewing on most any resolution. Its height
    will be based on the content of the page. The template will also be centered
    in the page.</p>
    <h2>Browser Requirements</h2>
    <p>All pages should be viewable in the major browsers: Internet Explorer,
    Mozilla Firefox, Opera, and Google Chrome w/ minor if any differences.</p>
    <h2>Frames</h2>
    <p>Frames are not to be used!</p>
    <h2>Graphics</h2>
    <p>Images included should be one of the common suportable images types,
    such as jpeg, png, and gif. They should be appropriately sized, and
    geared towards optimum loading speed.</p>
    <h2>Typography</h2>
    Body Text
        <ul><li>Font Family defined as "Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, Sans-serif"</li>
            <li>Font size: 12px</li>
            <li>Line height: 18px</li>
            <li>Font Color: #666666</li>
        </ul>
    Footer Text
        <ul><li>Font Family defined as "Tahoma, Arial, Helvetica, Sans-serif"</li>
            <li>Font size: 10px</li>
            <li>Color: #c9c9c9</li>
            <li>Hover Color: #C00000</li>
        </ul>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Colors</h2>
    <p>The color scheme is simple, the color red and a mix of grayscale colors. The color red found in
    the favicon, navigation bar, etc is #C00000. A standard white backgorund will
    be used in the content section of the page, and the background will like colors, mostly
    black, white and gray colors.</p>
    <h2>Navigation</h2>
    <p>The main navigation will be located just below the header, and arrowws will point at
        the links when the mouse hovers over them. They will be created using
    images so that I can be more free w/ my font choice and rollover effect. The blue "image link" border should
    be taken out using css, and margins will need to be adapted so that images can sit right
    next to each other. </p>
    <p>Links within the content of the page will be the same color as normal test, but will
       be underlined to show that they are links. They will change to the hex color code
       #C00000 when the mouse hovers over them. There is also navigation located in the footer,
       and it is set to align with the right edge of the page. It also employs the rollover
       color-changing effect.</p>
    <p>Overall, navigation should be simple and intuitive. Links should be clearly labeled.</p>
    <h2>Content</h2>
    <p>The content of the page overall should be sensible and useful. Don't be
    overly wordy or confusing. Content should be arranged in an aesthetically pleasing
    way, and tend lean towards a very simple and clean appearance. Extra divs may be created
    within the content div, but divs outside the main container are not to be created.</p>
    <h2>Logo</h2>
    <p><img src="/oldsite/images/cflogo.gif" alt="coryfugate.com logo" /></p>
    <p>The logos filename is cflogo.gif. It is a simple red box with a white lowercase
        cf aligned to the right. It should be seen on everypage and used in a professional
        way.</p>
