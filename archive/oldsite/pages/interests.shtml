        <h1>Interests</h1>
        <h2>Music</h2>
        <p>My favorite hobby is to play music. I bought my first
            drumset when I was sixteen and soon after picked up the guitar, and
            spent much of high school playing covers and writing orignal
            music with friends and family.</p>
        <p>In my current location in Rexburg I don't always have access to a drumset,
            but my roomates and I all experiment with a few different instruments. We've got
            a couple guitars laying around, a set of bongos, and I also picked up a
            ukulele. Many nights are spent relaxing in the living room jamming and
            freestyling some music.</p>
        <p><a href="/oldsite/videos/shesmine.wmv" target="_blank" title="She's Mine">
            Check out this quick clip</a> from a goofy jam session, a song we wrote for
            the ward's talent show, basically an LDS version of "I'm Yours." Honestly
            a little embarassing, but we had a fun time with it.</p>
        <p>I love most all music, but my favorite have always been rock and acoustic
            music. Some of my favorite bands and artists are Jack Johnson, Dashboard Confessional,
            Jimmy Eat World, Relient K, Bayside, The Almost, and Switchfoot, along with
            lots of others.</p>
        <h2>Activities</h2>
        <p> I love doing things outside, and there's plenty of spots for that here
            close to Rexburg. Yellowstone National Park is minutes away, and their are
            lots of other caves, rivers, mountains, and even sand dunes close
            by. There also plenty of people around to get together and play all kinds of
            sports, and I enjoy playing most anything.</p>
        <h2>Movies</h2>
        <p> During the winters here it's freezing, so that leaves lots of time for
            indoor activities, especially movie watching. I've always enjoyed movies,
            especially from an artists point of few. I love being entertained by
            excellent examples of special effects and cinemtography, and enjoy picking
            apart the elements of a good story. Just to throw up a list of some movies
            I enjoy-Jurrasic Park, M Night Shyamalan Movies, Chris Farley Movies,
            The Fugitive, Forest Gump, Star Wars, X-Men, The Matrix, Casino Royale,
            The Bourne Series, The Count Of Monte Cristo, The Green Mile, The Blindside,
            Mr. Holland's Opus, Gladiator, and countless others.</p>
