        <h3>Opdrop Logo Redesign</h3>
        <img src="images/portfolio/opdrop-logo-old.jpg" alt="old opdrop logo"><img src="images/portfolio/opdrop-logo-new.jpg" alt="new opdrop logo">
        <p>I've recently joined the founding team of a new web startup called Opdrop,
        which is out to change the world by providing a platform to share opinions and
        reviews on any topic. Kind of like a Yelp for everything, but a lot cooler. My
        primary responsibility is to work on the redesign of the site, and that began with
        some rebranding.</p>
        <p>You'll see that I changed the colors slightly, switching from a washed out gray
        to solid black (or white), and added a slight gradient for more pop. The little
        message bubble that used to live just in the first "o" of opdrop was moved over to
        the "p" and "d" to further suggest that our site is all about conversation and
        contrasting opinions. I also switched the font over to a slab serif, which I felt gave us a
        bit more of a current feel, and stands out over some of the typical
        sans serif fonts. Overall the changes aren't drastic, but I think they are poignant
        and effective. </p>

        <h3>Radionut Logo Design</h3>
        <span class="radionut"><img src="images/portfolio/radio-logo-1.jpg" alt="radionut logo">
            <img src="images/portfolio/radio-logo-2.jpg" alt="radionut logo">
            <img src="images/portfolio/radio-logo-3.jpg" alt="radionut logo"></span>
        <p>These logos are from an older project in my Intro to Visual Media class about 2 years
            ago. We were asked to come up with some new business or entity and design three logos for it.
            I created a fictional web radio company called "Radionut." All three were created as
            vector graphics in Adobe Illustrator.</p>
        <h3>Jnick and Joie Logo Design</h3>
        <img src="images/portfolio/jnick-logo-1.jpg" alt="jnick and joie logo design process"> <img src="images/portfolio/jnick-logo-2.jpg" alt="jnick and joie logo variations">
        <p>The logo's were commissioned by a friend who was looking to start a t-shirt company. He gave me an old
        photograph of a logo he had designed previously, and my job was to create a streamlined digital version
        of that.</p>
