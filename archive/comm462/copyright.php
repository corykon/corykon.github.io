        <h2>Copyright</h2>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>All privately produced creative works, whether specifically marked as
           copyrighted or not, are protected under the Berne Copyright Convention.
           This includes endeavors in any creative form, whether it be written content,
           illustrations/graphics design, or any other form of media, and extends to
           anything created after April 1, 1989. Copyright on these items is established
           immediately as they are produced in tangible form, and lasts until 50 years
           after the author has died.</p>
        <p>Copyright protects the monetary value of such creations for their designers,
           thus encouraging the sharing of creative works. Copyright guarantees the following
           for its owner:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The right to reproduce the work</li>
            <li>The right to create a new work, based on the original(a derivative work)</li>
            <li>The right to share and distribute the work in any form</li>
        </ul>
        <p> The <strong>violation of Copyright laws</strong> is a civil matter, and as such will result
            in a lawsuit, potentially leading to lawsuits of up to $100,000 in civil
            damages. Cases of infringement which include more than 10 copies or a value
            of over $2,500 can result in a felony.</p>

        <p> The <strong>Fair Use Guidelines</strong> are a set of rules that outline when

            are a few basic descriptions of these guidelines:</p>

            <li>Students may incorporate portions of lawfully acquired copyrighted works
                when producing their own educational multimedia projects for a specific course</li>
            <li>Students may use up to 10% or 3 minutes of video, which is ever is less</li>
            <li>They may use 10% or 1,000 words of written material, which ever is less</li>
