    <p>From 2013 to 2016, I worked for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints developing applications for the missionary department. While I won't discuss or show specifics of the apps here (were only for private/internal use), I do want to make mention of some of the technologies I worked with.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Cordova Mobile Development</h3>
    <p>The first year or so I spent working on a <strong>hybrid HTML 5 Cordova</strong> app, targeting the <strong>Android and iOS</strong> platforms. We worked with a framework called <strong>Sencha Touch</strong>, used <strong>SASS precompiled CSS</strong>, and a WebSQL database. This app was primarily for offline use, and user could periodically sync to share data with our central servers. I spent a bit of time on our Java backend server, but primarily focused on <strong>front end feature development</strong>.</p>
    <h3>Web development</h3>
    <p>Following that, I developed a few <strong>Angular based web apps</strong>. During this time I had the opportunity to work more extensively with package managers like <strong>npm and Bower</strong>, which I came to love. We also used the super useful task runners <strong>Grunt and Gulp</strong> for various projects. My javascript unit testing framework of choice was <strong>Jasmine</strong>, but we also tinkered with others. Again we worked with mostly Java backend services, but I also had some exposure to <strong>Node.js</strong> backends.</p>
    <h3>Native iOS Development</h3>
    <p>Starting in fall of 2015, I moved into native <strong>iOS development with Swift</strong>. We're creating an offline mapping app that I'm extremely proud of. Working in the iOS environment has been a blast. While I appreciate the great things you can do with a Cordova/Phonegap app, there's a lot of power in working with the native SDK. Along with that, I'm loving Swift— I appreciate the safe types, using protocols over subclassing, value types, and other benefits of having a compiled language.</p>
