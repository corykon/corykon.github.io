    <p>I built this while working for Domo Technologies as my entry in a company-wide dashboard competition, and it ended up winning me a trip to Cabo San Lucas. You can compare stats of thousands of NBA players in various ways, and quickly compile top ten lists in several categories. It was built using one of Domo's legacy products, called Centerview Server.  </p>
