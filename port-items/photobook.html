    <p>This is the final project from a photography class a BYU-Idaho. At the end of the semester we designed a photobook to showcase our favorite pictures from each week. Took the pictures with a Canon Rebel XS, and edited them using Photoshop and Camera Raw. The book itself was also created in Photoshop.</p>
