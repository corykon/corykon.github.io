    <p>I was the UX designer and lead front end engineer for the Population Builder web application. It features a slick drag and drop interface that enables non-technical users to write complex healthcare database queries that are translated into SQL. It was a major part of an initiative for "self-service anayltics", and it was all about getting data to the masses.</p>
    <p>In 2020, the application was awarded <a class="simple-link" href="https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/industry-blog/health/2020/05/19/congratulations-to-our-2020-health-innovation-award-winners/" target="_blank">Microsoft's Health Innovation Award</a> in the "Improve Operational Outcomes" category.</p>
